Media playback is not supported on this device Tense finish as England v South Africa goes down to final ball Second one-day international, Southampton: England 330-6 (50 overs): Stokes 101 (79), Buttler 65* (53) South Africa 328-5 (50 overs): De Kock 98, Plunkett 3-64 England won by two runs Match scorecard Mark Wood bowled a brilliant final over to give England a two-run win over South Africa that sealed the one-day international series in Southampton. The Proteas needed seven from the 50th over, but Wood limited them to four. Ben Stokes, an injury doubt before the game, was dropped twice in making a 79-ball 101 that helped England to 330-6. Quinton de Kock (98), AB de Villiers (52) and David Miller (71 not out) led the chase, but Chris Morris could not hit the last ball for four. The series concludes at Lord's on Monday in what will be England's final game before they begin the Champions Trophy against Bangladesh at The Oval on Thursday. Not only will they start as favourites with the bookmakers, but also on the back of a series victory against the world number ones. Relive England's thrilling victory with full video highlights Wood holds nerve in final-over thriller Mark Wood conceded only 48 runs from his 10 overs England's batting is their great strength in ODIs - they have scored runs more quickly than other side for the past two years - but their bowling could be seen as a weakness, leaking runs faster than all teams but Sri Lanka. Wood had his winter wrecked by injury, but his pace offers a wicket-taking threat, albeit he struggled in the opening win at Headingley on Wednesday. South Africa were ahead of the chase throughout, even after De Kock and De Villiers departed in the space of four overs after sharing a stand of 96. Miller arrived to muscle the ball to the leg side, while Morris punished any error in length - at one point Wood and Jake Ball conceded 20 runs in the space of six balls. With 10 balls remaining, South Africa needed only 10, but Ball regained his composure to make that seven from six. England took their time, the impressive Wood consulted with captain Morgan after every delivery and South Africa barely laid bat on ball. Stokes makes South Africa pay Media playback is not supported on this device Stokes century helps England seal series win Asked to bat, England were wobbling at 80-3 and could have been in a worse position. Stokes was reprieved on nought off the spin of debutant spinner Keshav Maharaj - Hashim Amla did not even get a hand on the slip catch - and, from the next ball, wicketkeeper De Kock spilled a tougher chance. The left-hander made the Proteas pay in a second ODI ton full of power on the leg side and down the ground. He shared stands of 95 with Morgan and 77 with Jos Buttler, who overcame an uncertain start to post a welcome 65 not out from 53 balls. Stokes cleared the leg-side fence three times, his second 50 coming in only 29 balls before he was caught at long-off from the bowling of Maharaj. He then took the ball to claim England's first wicket - Amla caught at extra cover - but the knee problem limited the Durham man to only three overs in what is undoubtedly a concern ahead of the Champions Trophy. South Africa fall short again In the first ODI at Headingley, South Africa made a strong start in a chase of 340, only to fall away. Then they contributed to their own downfall, but here they were squeezed out by England. While De Kock and De Villiers were together, South Africa were cruising. De Kock, who survived a very tough caught-and-bowled chance to Stokes on 22, targeted mid-wicket, while De Villiers characteristically scored through 360 degrees. But after De Villiers gloved a Liam Plunkett short ball through to wicketkeeper Buttler, an increasingly twitchy De Kock edged a Moeen Ali off-break to the same man. Miller received little support from Farhaan Behardien, but the arrival of Morris once again made the highest successful run-chase by a visiting team in England seem possible. That was until Wood's final over. Media playback is not supported on this device Joe Root is run out as Eoin Morgan's shot hits the stumps at the non-striker's end. Defeat from the jaws of victory - what they said England captain Eoin Morgan: ""Those are the sort of games you really want to win, you learn a more from these games. ""It really got away from us for a while but Mark Wood coming up with the goods at the end was awesome. ""The Champions Trophy is bound to be tight so this preparation is ideal. It helps us massively for the tournament. ""Woody usually bowls yorkers but he adjusted to conditions at the end with the short ball and it was really impressive."" Man of the match Ben Stokes: ""Mark Wood bowled really well and it was an amazing effort from him. ""It shows what a bit of pace does - it makes it harder for batsmen at the end to strike the ball cleanly. ""Batting is fine but my bowling is affected by my knee. I'm not quite sure what it is but I have a couple more scans to come and hopefully it will settle down."" South Africa captain AB de Villiers: ""I thought the boys played exceptionally well but England got their plans right and showed guts at the finish. ""The result is unfortunate but I'm proud of the way we played. I thought we paced it really well but we couldn't cross the line. ""I think our fielding was costly. We were a little bit careless at times, conceding one or two more boundaries than we should have done."" Former England off-spinner Graeme Swann: ""That's a brilliant series win and on the brink of a major tournament in this country it's a fantastic win from that situation. Somehow Jake Ball and Mark Wood have only gone for a run a ball - quite brilliant death bowling. ""South Africa can't believe they haven't won that. England have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.""

12," Cricket - Wikipedia Cricket From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This article is about the sport. For the insect, see Cricket (insect) . For other uses, see Cricket (disambiguation) . ""Cricketer"" redirects here. For other uses, see Cricketer (disambiguation) . Cricket A cricket game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne , Victoria , Australia Highest governing body International Cricket Council First played 18th century (modern version – see history ) Characteristics Contact No Team members 11 players per side ( substitutes permitted in some circumstances) Mixed gender yes, separate competitions Type team sport , bat-and-ball Equipment cricket ball , cricket bat , wicket ( stumps , bails ), various protective equipment Venue cricket field Presence Country or region Australasia , United Kingdom , Indian subcontinent , Southern Africa , Caribbean Olympic No ( 1900 Summer Olympics only) Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a cricket field , at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a wicket (a set of three wooden stumps ) at each end. One team bats , attempting to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents field . Each phase of play is called an innings . After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a fixed number of overs have been completed, the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles. The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained, during their innings. At the start of each game, two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play. The play begins when a member of the fielding team, known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other, towards the wicket at that end, in front of which stands one of the batsmen, known as the striker. The striker ""takes guard"" on a crease drawn on the pitch four feet in front of the wicket. His role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps by use of his bat , and simultaneously to strike it well enough to score runs. The other batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the opposite end of the pitch near the bowler. A dismissed batsman must leave the field, and a teammate replaces him. The bowler's objectives are to prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman. An over is a set of six deliveries bowled by the same bowler. The next over is bowled from the other end of the pitch by a different bowler. The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball; leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat; and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground. Runs are scored by two main methods: either by hitting the ball hard enough for it to cross the boundary , or by the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball. If a fielder retrieves the ball quickly enough to put down the wicket with a batsman not having reached the crease at that end of the pitch, that batsman is dismissed (a run-out occurs). Adjudication is performed on the field by two umpires . The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs (i.e. 120 deliveries), to Test cricket , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid object made of compressed leather enclosing a cork core. Although cricket's origins are uncertain, it is first recorded in south-east England in the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, leading to the first international matches in the mid-19th century. ICC, the game's governing body, has over 100 members, ten of which are full members who play Test cricket. The sport is followed primarily in Australasia, Britain, the Indian subcontinent, southern Africa and the West Indies. Women's cricket , which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard.

In the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598 it is called creckett . [1] One possible source for the name is the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff. [2] In Samuel Johnson 's Dictionary , he derived cricket from "" cryce , Saxon, a stick"". [3] In Old French , the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick. [2] Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy , the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) krick ( -e ), meaning a stick (crook). [2] Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel , meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket. [4] According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University , ""cricket"" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey , met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., ""with the stick chase""). [5] Dr Gillmeister believes that not only the name but the sport itself is of Flemish origin. [6] History Main article: History of cricket Cricket can definitely be traced back to Tudor times in early 16th-century England though there have been a number of claims, many of them spurious and/or lacking evidence, supporting earlier dates from 1301. The earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a 1598 court case which mentions that ""creckett"" ( sic ) was played on common land in Guildford around 1550. The court in Guildford heard on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date, equating to the year 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) from a 59-year-old coroner , John Derrick , who gave witness that when he was a scholar at the ""Free School at Guildford"", fifty years earlier, ""hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play [on the common land] at creckett and other plaies."" [3] [7] Francis Cotes , The Young Cricketer , 1768 It is believed that cricket was originally a children's game but references in 1611 [3] indicate that adults had started playing it and the earliest known organised inter-parish or village cricket match was played around that time. [8] In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex. [9] During the 17th century, numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of England. By the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that the first professionals appeared in the years following the Restoration in 1660. A newspaper report survives of ""a great cricket match"" with eleven players a side that was played for high stakes in Sussex in 1697, and this is the earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance. [10] The game underwent major development in the 18th century. Betting played a key part in that development with rich patrons forming their own ""select XIs"". Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season . Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball , it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old ""hockey stick"" shape. The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of cricket . New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw). The first English team to tour overseas, on board ship to North America, 1859 The 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling . Both developments were controversial. Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839, which ultimately formed the official County Championship in 1890. Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in India, North America, the Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between the United States and Canada . In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tour . The first Australian team to tour overseas was a team of Aboriginal stockmen who travelled to England in 1868 to play matches against county teams. [11] In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia. The most famous player of the 19th century was W. G. Grace , who started his long and influential career in 1865. Don Bradman of Australia had a record Test batting average of 99.94. In 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia . The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882 and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest. Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England. The last two decades before the First World War have been called the "" Golden Age of cricket "". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed. The inter-war years were dominated by one player: Australia's Don Bradman , statistically the greatest batsman of all time. Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the West Indies , India and New Zealand before the Second World War and then Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Zimbabwe and Bangladesh in the post-war period. South Africa was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 as part of the apartheid boycott . Cricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant. As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased. The first Limited Overs International was played in 1971. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) saw its potential and staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975. In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20 , has made an immediate impact. While some English team games like hockey and football became international games, played all over the world, cricket remained a colonial game, limited to those countries that had once been a part of the British empire . The pre-industrial oddness of cricket made it a hard game to export. It took root only in countries that the British conquered and ruled. In these colonies cricket was established as a popular sport either by white settlers or by local elites who wanted to copy the habits of their colonial masters, as in India. Rules and game-play Main article: Laws of cricket Cricket is a bat and ball game, played between two teams of eleven players each. [12] [13] One team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen. The objective of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent. In some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn . Format of the game A cricket match is divided into periods called innings (which ends with ""s"" in both singular and plural form). It is decided before the match whether the teams will have one innings or two innings each. During an innings one team fields and the other bats . The two teams switch between fielding and batting after each innings. All eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but only two members of the batting team (two batsmen ) are on the field at any given time. The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied. A coin toss is held by the team captains (who are also players) just before the match starts: the winner decides whether to bat or field first. The cricket field is usually circular or oval in shape, with a rectangular pitch at the centre. The edge of the playing field is marked with a boundary , which could be a fence, part of the stands, a rope or a painted line. At each end of the pitch is a wooden target called a wicket ; the two wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart. The pitch is marked with painted lines: a bowling crease in line with the wicket, and a batting or popping crease 1.22 m (4 ft) in front of it. The wicket is made of three vertical stumps supporting two small horizontal bails . A wicket is put down if at least one bail is dislodged, or one stump is knocked down (usually by the ball, but also if the batsman does it with his body, clothing or equipment). This is also described as breaking , knocking down , or hitting the wicket – though if the ball hits the wicket but does not dislodge a bail or stump then it is not considered to be down. At any instant each batsman ""owns"" a particular wicket (usually the one closer to him) and, except when actually batting, is safe when he is in his ground . This means that at least one part of his body or bat is touching the ground behind the popping crease . If his wicket is put down while the ball is live and he is out of his ground then he is dismissed, but the other batsman is safe. [14] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 1 Umpire 2 Wicket 3 Non-striking batsman 4 Bowler 5 Ball 6 Pitch 7 Crease 8 Striking batsman 9 Wicket 10 Wicket-keeper 11 First slip 12 Return crease The two batsmen take positions at opposite ends of the pitch. One designated member of the fielding team, called the bowler , bowls the ball from one end of the pitch to the striking batsman at the other end. The batsman at the bowling end is called the non-striker , and stands to the side of his wicket, behind his crease. The batsman are allowed to step forward of their creases, though at some risk. Another member of the fielding team, the wicket keeper , is positioned behind the striker's wicket. The fielding team's other nine members stand outside the pitch, spread out across the field. The fielding captain often tactically changes their position between balls. There is always an umpire at each end of the pitch. The bowler usually retreats a few yards (metres) behind the wicket, runs towards it (his run-up ), and then releases the ball over-hand as he reaches the bowling crease . (If he crosses the crease before he releases the ball, or if he flexes his elbow too much in a throw , then it is a no ball , the batsman cannot be dismissed, and the batting team gets a penalty or extra run. If the ball passes the far wicket out of reach of the batsman then it is called a wide , also with an extra run.) The ball can be bowled so that it bounces on the pitch, lands exactly on the crease (a yorker ), or crosses the crease without bouncing (a full toss ). A no ball or a wide does not count towards the six balls in the over. The batsman tries to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket by striking the ball with his bat. (This includes the handle of the bat, and his gloves.) If the bowler succeeds in putting down the wicket the batsman is dismissed and is said to be bowled out . If the batsman misses the ball, but any part of his body prevents it from reaching the wicket, then he is out leg before wicket , or ""LBW"". If the batsman hits the ball but it is caught by a fielder without bouncing then he is caught out. If it is caught by the bowler then he is caught and bowled ; by the wicket keeper, caught behind . If the batsman is successful in striking the ball and it is not caught without bouncing, then the two batsmen may try to score points ( runs ) for their team. Both batsmen run the length of the pitch, exchanging positions, and grounding their bats behind the opposite crease. Each crossing and grounding by both batsmen is worth one run. The batsmen may attempt one run, or multiple runs, or elect not to run at all. By attempting runs, the batsmen risk dismissal. This happens if the fielding team retrieves the ball and hits either wicket with the ball (either by throwing it, or while holding it) before the batsman who owns that wicket reaches his ground behind the crease. The dismissed batsman is run out . Batsmen will sometimes start to run, change their minds, and return to their original positions. If the batsman hits the ball over the field boundary without the ball touching the field, the batting team scores six runs. If the ball touches the ground and then reaches the boundary, the batting team scores four runs. The batsmen might have started running before the ball reaches the boundary, but those runs do not count. If the batsman misses the ball they can still attempt extra runs : these are called byes . If the ball bounces off his body then it is called a leg bye . If the striking batsman leaves his ground and misses the ball, then the wicket keeper can catch it and put down the wicket – out stumped . In case of a no ball or a wide the batsman can choose to strike the ball, earning runs in addition to the fixed penalty. If he does so he can only be dismissed by being run out . When the batsmen have finished attempting their runs the ball is dead , and is returned to the bowler to be bowled again. The ball becomes live when he starts his run up . The bowler continues to bowl toward the same wicket, regardless of any switch of the batsmen's positions. [15] A batsman may retire from an innings without being dismissed, usually after reaching a milestone like a hundred runs (a century ). A dismissed batsman leaves the field, to be replaced by another batsman from the batting team. However, even though the wicket may have been put down, or the ball caught, the batsman is not actually dismissed until the fielding team appeal to the umpires for a decision, traditionally using the expression ""How's that"" (or ""Howzat"") (although often the batsman will immediately walk away without the need for an appeal). In some matches, particularly Test matches, either team may request a review by a third umpire who can use a decision review system (DRS), which includes TV replays and other electronic equipment such as Hawk-Eye , Hot Spot and the Snickometer . After a bowler has bowled six times (an over ), another member of the fielding team is designated as the new bowler, the old bowler taking up a fielding position. The batsmen stay in place, and the new bowler bowls to the opposite wicket, so the roles of striker and non-striker reverse. The wicket keeper and the two umpires always change positions, as do many of the fielders, and play continues. Bowlers may (and usually do) bowl multiple times during an innings, but may not bowl two overs in succession. The innings is complete when 10 of the 11 members of the batting team have been dismissed ( all out – although one always remaining ""not out""), when a set number of overs has been played, or when the batting team declares that they have enough runs. The number of innings and the number of overs per innings vary depending on the format of the match. In a match which is not a limited overs format the umpires will often specify that the last session of the day will have a specified number of overs rather than continuing until a specified time (to avoid time wasting by either team). The match ends when all innings have been completed. The umpires can also call an end to the match in case of bad light or weather. But often the match ends immediately when one team to bat has completed its innings or both its innings, and the other team already has more runs. In four-innings games the last team may not even need to play its second innings: this team is said to win by an innings . If the winning team has not completed its last innings, and still has, for example, five batsmen who are not out or have not even batted, then they are said to ""win by five wickets"". If the last team to bat is all out and loses the match because it has say 50 fewer runs than the other team, then the winning team ""wins by 50 runs"". In the rare event that the two teams both complete their innings and they have the same number of runs, then it is a tie . In matches which are not limited overs there is also the possibility of a draw : the team with fewer runs still has batsmen on the field when the game ends, usually because time has run out. This has an impact on strategy: a team will often declare their innings closed when they have accumulated enough runs, in the hope that they will have enough time left to dismiss the other team and thus avoid a draw, but risking a loss if the other team scores enough runs. Pitch, wickets and creases Main articles: Cricket pitch , Wicket , and Crease (cricket) See also: Stump (cricket) and Bail (cricket) Playing surface A typical cricket field . Cricket is played on a grassy field . [16] The Laws of Cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field, [17] but it is often oval. In the centre of the field is a rectangular strip, known as the pitch . [16] The pitch is a flat surface 3 metres (9.8 ft) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses. [18] At either end of the pitch, 22 yards (20.1 m) apart, are placed wooden targets, known as the wickets . These serve as a target for the bowling (also known as the fielding ) side and are defended by the batting side, which seeks to accumulate runs. Stumps, bails and creases A wicket consists of three stumps that are hammered into the ground, and topped with two bails . Each wicket on the pitch consists of three wooden stumps placed vertically, in line with one another. They are surmounted by two wooden crosspieces called bails ; the total height of the wicket including bails is 72 centimetres (28 in) and the combined width of the three stumps, including small gaps between them is 23 centimetres (9 in). Four lines, known as creases , are painted onto the pitch around the wicket areas to define the batsman's ""safe territory"" and to determine the limit of the bowler's approach. These are called the ""popping"" (or batting) crease, the bowling crease and two ""return"" creases. The stumps are placed in line on the bowling creases and so these creases must be 22 yards (20 m) apart. A bowling crease is 2.64 metres (8.7 ft) long, with the middle stump placed dead centre. The popping crease has the same length, is parallel to the bowling crease and is 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) in front of the wicket. The return creases are perpendicular to the other two; they are adjoined to the ends of the popping crease and are drawn through the ends of the bowling crease to a length of at least 2.4 metres (7.9 ft). When bowling the ball, the bowler's back foot in his ""delivery stride"" must land within the two return creases while at least some part of his front foot must land on or behind the popping crease. If the bowler breaks this rule, the umpire calls "" No ball "". The importance of the popping crease to the batsman is that it marks the limit of his safe territory. He can be dismissed stumped or run out (see Dismissals below) if the wicket is broken while he is ""out of his ground"". Bat and ball Main articles: Cricket bat and Cricket ball Two different types of cricket balls : i) A used white ball. White balls are mainly used in limited overs cricket , especially in matches played at night, under floodlights (left). ii) A used red ball, Red balls are used in Test cricket and first-class cricket and some other forms of cricket (right). NB Both balls are the same size. The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers the ball from his end of the pitch towards the batsman who, armed with a bat is ""on strike"" at the other end. The bat is made of wood (usually White Willow ) and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than 10.8 centimetres (4.25 in) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 97 centimetres (38 in). The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid , with a circumference of 22.9 centimetres (9.0 in). The hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph), is a matter for concern and batsmen wear protective clothing including pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves for the hands, a helmet for the head and a box inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area). Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The ball has a ""seam"": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent, and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During cricket matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable, and during the course of this deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and thus influence the match. Players will therefore attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing, while rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam is illegal ball tampering . Umpires and scorers Main articles: Umpire (cricket) and Scorer An umpire The game on the field is regulated by two umpires , one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called ""square leg"", a position 15–20 metres to the side of the ""on strike"" batsman. The main role of the umpires is to adjudicate on whether a ball is correctly bowled (not a no ball or a wide ), when a run is scored, and whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase How's That? ). Umpires also determine when intervals start and end, decide on the suitability of the playing conditions and can interrupt or even abandon the match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light. Off the field and in televised matches, there is often a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test matches and limited overs internationals played between two ICC full members. These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws of cricket and the spirit of the game. The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers , one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire. For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws of cricket to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game. Innings The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for the collective performance of the batting side. [19] Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. The main aim of the bowler, supported by his fielders, is to dismiss the batsman. A batsman when dismissed is said to be ""out"" and that means he must leave the field of play and be replaced by the next batsman on his team. When ten batsmen have been dismissed (i.e. are out), then the whole team is dismissed and the innings is over. The last batsman, the one who has not been dismissed, is not allowed to continue alone as there must always be two batsmen ""in"". This batsman is termed ""not out"". An innings can end early for three reasons: because the batting side's captain has chosen to ""declare"" the innings closed (which is a tactical decision), or because the batting side has achieved its target and won the game, or because the game has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time. In each of these cases the team's innings ends with two ""not out"" batsmen, unless the innings is declared closed at the fall of a wicket and the next batsman has not joined in the play. In limited overs cricket, there might be two batsmen still ""not out"" when the last of the allotted overs has been bowled. Overs Main article: Over (cricket) The bowler bowls the ball in sets of six deliveries (or ""balls"") and each set of six balls is called an over . This name came about because the umpire calls ""Over!"" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs. The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. (Sometimes when one of the two batsmen is a much stronger player than the other, he tries to score a single run from the last ball of the over so that he can remain ""on strike"".) The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at square leg now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa. The only occasion where one bowler bowls consecutive overs is in the Super Over directly after the final over of a tied game of a limited-overs match. [20] Team structure A team consists of eleven players. Depending on his or her primary skills, a player may be classified as a specialist batsman or bowler . A well-balanced team usually has five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers. Teams nearly always include a specialist wicket-keeper because of the importance of this fielding position. Each team is headed by a captain who is responsible for making tactical decisions such as determining the batting order, the placement of fielders and the rotation of bowlers. A player who excels in both batting and bowling is known as an all-rounder . One who excels as a batsman and wicket-keeper is known as a ""wicket-keeper/batsman"", sometimes regarded as a type of all-rounder. True all-rounders are rare as most players focus on either batting or bowling skills. Bowling Main article: Bowling (cricket) Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan holds the world record for delivering the fastest ball (161.3 km/h). [21] The bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a ""run-up"", although some bowlers with a very slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. A fast bowler needs momentum and takes quite a long run-up, running very fast as he does so. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile. Some fast bowlers make use of the seam of the ball so that it ""curves"" or ""swings"" in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be ""caught behind"" by the wicketkeeper or a slip fielder. At the other end of the bowling scale is the ""spinner"" who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman. A spinner will often ""buy his wicket"" by ""tossing one up"" (in a slower, steeper parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot. The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often ""flighted"" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be ""trapped"" into getting himself out. In between the pacemen and the spinners are the ""medium pacers"" who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration. All bowlers are classified according to their looks or style. The classifications , as with much cricket terminology, can be very confusing. Hence, a bowler could be classified as LF, meaning he is a left arm fast bowler; or as LBG, meaning he is a right arm spin bowler who bowls deliveries that are called a "" leg break "" and a "" Googly "". During the bowling action the elbow may be held at any angle and may bend further, but may not straighten out. If the elbow straightens illegally then the square-leg umpire may call no-ball : this is known as ""throwing"" or ""chucking"", and can be difficult to detect. The current laws allow a bowler to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less. Fielding Main article: Fielding (cricket) Fielding positions in cricket for a right-handed batsman All eleven players on the fielding side take the field together. One of them is the wicket-keeper (or ""keeper"") who operates behind the wicket being defended by the batsman on strike. Wicket-keeping is normally a specialist occupation and his primary job is to gather deliveries that the batsman does not hit, so that the batsmen cannot run byes. He wears special gloves (he is the only fielder allowed to do so), a box over the groin, and pads to cover his lower legs. He is the only player who can get a batsman out stumped . Apart from the one currently bowling, the other nine fielders are tactically deployed by the team captain in chosen positions around the field. The captain is the most important member of the fielding side as he determines all the tactics including who should bowl (and how); and he is responsible for ""setting the field"", though usually in consultation with the bowler. In all forms of cricket, if a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him. The substitute cannot bowl, act as a captain or keep wicket. The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return. Batting Main article: batting (cricket) English cricketer W.G. Grace ""taking guard"" in 1883. His pads and bat are very similar to those used today. The gloves have evolved somewhat. Many modern players utilise more defensive equipment than was available to Grace, notably helmets and arm guards. At any one time, there are two batsmen in the playing area. One takes station at the striker's end to defend the wicket as above and to score runs if possible. His partner, the non-striker, is at the end where the bowler is operating. Batsmen come in to bat in a batting order , decided by the team captain usually after consulting the team coach, though the captain is not bound to consult the coach. The first two batsmen – the ""openers"" – usually face the hostile bowling from fresh fast bowlers with a new ball. The top batting positions are usually given to the most competent batsmen in the team, and the team's bowlers – who are typically, but not always, less skilled as batsmen – typically bat last. The pre-announced batting order is not mandatory; when a wicket falls any player who has not yet batted may be sent in next. If a batsman ""retires"" (usually due to injury) and cannot return, he is actually ""not out"" and his retirement does not count as a dismissal, though in effect he has been dismissed because his innings is over. Substitute batsmen are not allowed. A skilled batsman can use a wide array of ""shots"" or ""strokes"" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an "" edge "". Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply ""blocking"" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run. An iconic image of Australia's Victor Trumper stepping out to drive There is a wide variety of shots played in cricket. The batsman's repertoire includes strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., "" cut "", ""drive"", ""hook"", ""pull"". A batsman is not required to play a shot; in the event that he believes the ball will not hit his wicket and there is no opportunity to score runs, he can ""leave"" the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. He can deliberately use his leg to block the ball and thereby ""pad it away"", but this is risky because of the leg before wicket rule. In the event of an injured batsman being fit to bat but not to run, the umpires and the fielding captain could previously allow another member of the batting side to be a runner . The runner's only task was to run between the wickets instead of the incapacitated batsman, and he was required to wear and carry exactly the same equipment as the batsman. As of 2011 the ICC outlawed the use of runners as they felt this was being abused. [22] Runs Main article: Run (cricket) Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar (second from right) is the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket. [23] Photo shows him making a shot to reach 14,000 runs in Tests . He was batting against Australia in 2010. The directions in which a right-handed batsman, facing down the page, intends to send the ball when playing various cricketing shots. The diagram for a left-handed batsman is a mirror image of this one. The batsman on strike (i.e. the ""striker"") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score. More than one run can be scored from a single hit: hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more. To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In these cases the batsmen do not need to run. Brian Lara of the West Indies holds the record for highest score in an innings for both Test and first-class cricket. Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of ""overthrows"" by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total. The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: ""yes"", ""no"" and ""wait"" are often heard. Running is a calculated risk because if a fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman is out of his ground (i.e. he does not have part of his body or bat in contact with the ground behind the popping crease), the batsman is run out . A team's score is reported in terms of the number of runs scored and the number of batsmen that have been dismissed. For example, if five batsmen are out and the team has scored 224 runs, they are said to have scored 224 for the loss of 5 wickets (commonly shortened to ""224 for five"" and written 224/5 or, in Australia, ""five for 224"" and 5/224). Extras Main article: Extra (cricket) Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called ""sundries"" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways: No ball : a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules of bowling either by (a) using an inappropriate arm action ; (b) overstepping the popping crease; (c) having a foot outside the return crease. In addition, the bowler has to re-bowl the ball. In limited overs matches, a no ball is called if the bowling team's field setting fails to comply with the restrictions. In shorter formats of the game (20–20, ODI) the free hit rule has been introduced. The ball following a front foot no-ball will be a free-hit for the batsman, whereby he is safe from losing his wicket except for being run-out. Wide : a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach; as with a no ball, a wide must be re-bowled. If a wide ball crosses the boundary, five runs are awarded to the batting side (one run for the wide, and four for the boundary). Bye : extra(s) awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicketkeeper to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way (note that one mark of a good wicketkeeper is one who restricts the tally of byes to a minimum). Leg bye : extra(s) awarded if the ball hits the batsman's body, but not his bat, while attempting a legitimate shot, and it goes away from the fielders to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way. When the bowler has bowled a no ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball. The batsmen have to run (i.e., unless the ball goes to the boundary for four) to claim byes and leg byes but these only count towards the team total, not to the striker's individual total for which runs must be scored off the bat. Dismissals Main article: Dismissal (cricket) There are eleven ways in which a batsman can be dismissed: five relatively common and six extremely rare. The common forms of dismissal are ""bowled"", ""caught"", ""leg before wicket"" (lbw), ""run out"", and (somewhat less common) ""stumped"". Rare methods are ""hit wicket"", ""hit the ball twice"", ""obstructed the field"", ""handled the ball"" and ""timed out"" – these are almost unknown in the professional game. The eleventh – retired out – is not treated as an on-field dismissal but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited. If the dismissal is obvious (for example when ""bowled"" and in most cases of ""caught"") the batsman will voluntarily leave the field without the umpire needing to dismiss them. Otherwise before the umpire will award a dismissal and declare the batsman to be out, a member of the fielding side (generally the bowler) must ""appeal"". This is invariably done by asking (or shouting) ""how's that?"" – normally reduced to howzat? If the umpire agrees with the appeal, he will raise a forefinger and say ""Out!"". Otherwise he will shake his head and say ""Not out"". Appeals are particularly loud when the circumstances of the claimed dismissal are unclear, as is always the case with lbw and often with run outs and stumpings. Bowled : the bowler has hit the wicket with the delivery and the wicket has ""broken"" with at least one bail being dislodged (if the ball hits the wicket without dislodging a bail it is not out). [24] Caught : the batsman has hit the ball with his bat, or with his hand which was holding the bat, and the ball has been caught before it has touched the ground by a member of the fielding side. [25] Leg before wicket (lbw) : the ball has hit the batsman's body (including his clothing, pads etc. but not the bat, nor a hand holding the bat) when it would have gone on to hit the stumps. This rule exists mainly to prevent the batsman from guarding his wicket with his legs instead of the bat. To be given out lbw, the ball must not bounce outside leg stump or strike the batsmen outside the line of leg-stump. It may bounce outside off-stump. The batsman may only be dismissed lbw by a ball striking him outside the line of off-stump if he has not made a genuine attempt to play the ball with his bat. [26] Run out : a member of the fielding side has broken or ""put down"" the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman was out of his ground; this occurs either by an accurate throw to the wicket, or more commonly by a throw to the wicketkeeper or other fielder standing near the wicket, while the batsmen are attempting a run, although a batsman can be given out ""run out"" even when he is not attempting a run; he merely needs to be out of his ground. [27] Stumped is similar except that it is done by the wicketkeeper after the batsman has missed the bowled ball and has stepped out of his ground, and is not attempting a run. [28] A batsman can be run out on a No ball , but cannot be stumped. Hit wicket : a batsman is out hit wicket if he dislodges one or both bails with his bat, person, clothing or equipment in the act of receiving a ball, or in setting off for a run having just received a ball. [29] Hit the ball twice is very unusual and was introduced as a safety measure to counter dangerous play and protect the fielders. The batsman may legally play the ball a second time only to stop the ball hitting the wicket after he has already played it. ""Hit"" does not necessarily refer to the batsman's bat. [30] Obstructing the field : another unusual dismissal which tends to involve a batsman deliberately getting in the way (physically and/or verbally) of a fielder. [31] Handled the ball : a batsman must not deliberately touch the ball with his hand, for example to protect his wicket. Note that the batsman's hand or glove counts as part of the bat while the hand is holding the bat, so batsmen are frequently caught off their gloves (i.e. the ball hits, and is deflected by, the glove and can then be caught). [32] Timed out ; means that the next batsman was not ready to receive a delivery within three minutes of the previous one being dismissed. [33] Retired out : a batsman retires without the umpire's permission, and does not have the permission of the opposition captain to resume their innings. [34] In the vast majority of cases, it is the striker who is out when a dismissal occurs. If the non-striker is dismissed it is usually by being run out, but he could also be dismissed for obstructing the field, handling the ball or being timed out. A batsman may leave the field without being dismissed. If injured or taken ill the batsman may temporarily retire, and be replaced by the next batsman. This is recorded as retired hurt or retired ill . The retiring batsman is not out, and may resume the innings later if he recovers. An unimpaired batsman may retire, and this is treated as being dismissed retired out ; no player is credited with the dismissal. Batsmen cannot be out bowled , caught , leg before wicket , stumped or hit wicket off a no ball . They cannot be out bowled , caught , leg before wicket , or hit the ball twice off a wide . Some of these modes of dismissal can occur without the bowler bowling a delivery. The batsman who is not on strike may be run out by the bowler if he leaves his crease before the bowler bowls, and a batsman can be out obstructing the field or retired out at any time. Timed out is, by its nature, a dismissal without a delivery. With all other modes of dismissal, only one batsman can be dismissed per ball bowled. Innings closed Main article: End of an innings (cricket) An innings is closed when: Ten of the eleven batsmen are out (have been dismissed); in this case, the team is said to be ""all out"" The team has only one batsman left who can bat, one or more of the remaining players being unavailable owing to injury, illness or absence; again, the team is said to be ""all out"" The team batting last reaches the score required to win the match The predetermined number of overs has been bowled (in a one-day match only, commonly 50 overs; or 20 in Twenty20 ) A captain declares his team's innings closed while at least two of his batsmen are not out (this does not apply in one-day limited over matches) Results Main article: Result (cricket) If the team that bats last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, the team is said to have ""lost by n runs"" (where n is the difference between the number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have ""won by n wickets"", where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For instance a team that passes its opponents' score having only lost six wickets would have won ""by four wickets"". In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have won by an innings and n runs , and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores. If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie ; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side. In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw . If the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of deliveries for each innings is often imposed. Such a match is called a ""limited overs"" or ""one-day"" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth-Lewis method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a ""no-result"" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather. Distinctive elements Individual focus For a team sport, cricket places individual players under unusual scrutiny and pressure. Bowler, batsman, and fielder all act essentially independently of each other. While team managements can signal to a bowler or batsman to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is slightly mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman's innings may continue for several hours. Spirit of the Game Cricket is a unique game where in addition to the laws, the players must abide by the ""Spirit of the Game"". [35] The standard of sportsmanship has historically been considered so high that the phrase ""it's just not cricket"" was coined in the 19th century to describe unfair or underhanded behaviour in any walk of life. In the last few decades though, with financial incentives, high-level cricket has become increasingly fast-paced and competitive, increasing the use of appealing and sledging , although players are still expected to abide by the umpires' rulings without argument, and for the most part they do. Beginning in 2001, the MCC has held an annual lecture named after Colin Cowdrey on the spirit of the game. [36] Even in the modern game fielders are known to signal to the umpire that a boundary was hit, despite what could have been considered a spectacular save (though sometimes they might be found out by the TV replays anyway). [ citation needed ] In addition to this, some batsmen have been known to ""walk"" when they think they are out even if the umpire does not declare them out. This is a high level of sportsmanship, as sometimes a batsman could take advantage of incorrect umpiring decisions. [ citation needed ] Influence of weather Floodlights at M. A. Chidambaram Stadium , Chennai Cricket is a sport played predominantly in the drier periods of the year. But, even so, the weather is a key factor in many cricket matches. Cricket cannot be played in wet weather. Dampness affects the bounce of the ball on the wicket and is a risk to all players involved in the game. Many grounds have facilities to cover the cricket pitch (or the wicket). Covers can be in the form of tarpaulins laid over the wicket, elevated covers on wheels (acting like an umbrella) or even hover covers which form an airtight seal around the wicket. However, most grounds do not have the facilities to cover the outfield. This means that in the event of heavy rain, a match may be cancelled, abandoned or suspended due to an unsafe outfield. Another factor in cricket is the amount of light available. At grounds without floodlights (or in game formats which disallow the use of floodlights), umpires can stop play in the event of bad light as it becomes too difficult for the batsmen (and in extreme cases, fielders) to see the ball coming at them. The sight-screens give a white background which help batsmen pick out the red ball (or a black background for a white ball). The umpires always have the final decision on weather-related issues. Uniqueness of each field Unlike those of most sports, cricket playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the pitch and infield are specifically regulated, the Laws of Cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field. [17] The field boundaries are sometimes painted and sometimes marked by a rope. Pitch and outfield variations can have a significant effect on how balls behave and are fielded as well as on batting. Pitches vary in consistency, and thus in the amount of bounce, spin, and seam movement available to the bowler. Hard pitches are usually good to bat on because of high but even bounce. Dry pitches tend to deteriorate for batting as cracks often appear, and when this happens to the pitch, spinners can play a key role. Damp pitches, or pitches covered in grass (termed ""green"" pitches), allow good fast bowlers to extract extra bounce. Such pitches tend to offer help to fast bowlers throughout the match, but become better for batting as the game goes on. While players of other outdoor sports deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardised. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ground. A given ground may acquire a reputation as batsman friendly or bowler friendly if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The absence of a standardised field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team makeup and players' statistical records. Types of matches Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats, varying playing standard and level of formality and the desired time that the match should last. A pertinent division in terms of professional cricket is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece, and those limited by number of overs, in which they have a single innings each. The former, known as first-class cricket , has a duration of three to five days (there have been examples of ""timeless"" matches too); the latter, known as limited overs cricket because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 or 20 overs, has a planned duration of one day only (a match can be extended if necessary due to bad weather, etc.). Typically, two-innings matches have at least six hours of playing time each day. Limited overs matches often last six hours or more. There are usually formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea with brief informal breaks for drinks. There is also a short interval between innings. Amateur cricketers rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided into declaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares ; and limited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually. These will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the ever-popular 20 over format during the evenings. Other forms of cricket, such as indoor cricket and garden cricket remain popular. Historically, a form of cricket known as single wicket had been extremely successful and many of these contests in the 18th and 19th centuries qualify as important matches . In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Test cricket Main article: Test cricket A Test match between South Africa and England in January 2005. The men wearing black trousers are the umpires . Teams in Test cricket, first-class cricket and club cricket wear traditional white uniforms and use red cricket balls . Test cricket is the highest standard of first-class cricket. A Test match is an international fixture between teams representing those countries that are Full Members of the ICC. Although the term ""Test match"" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–77 Australian season . Subsequently, eight other national teams have achieved Test status: South Africa (1889), West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1929), India (1932), Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992) and Bangladesh (2000). Zimbabwe suspended its Test status in 2006 due to its inability to compete against other Test teams, [37] and returned in 2011. [38] Welsh players are eligible to play for England , which is in effect an England and Wales team. The West Indies team comprises players from numerous states in the Caribbean , notably Barbados , Guyana , Jamaica , Trinidad & Tobago , the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands . Test matches between two teams are usually played in a group of matches called a "" series "". Matches last up to five days and a series normally consists of three to five matches. Test matches that are not finished within the allotted time are drawn. In the case of Test and first-class cricket : the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. [39] Since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes . Some other bilateral series have individual trophies too: for example, the Wisden Trophy is contested by England and West Indies; the Frank Worrell Trophy by Australia and West Indies and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia. Limited overs Main article: Limited overs cricket See also: One Day International and Twenty20 International Sir Viv Richards of the West Indies was voted by Wisden as the greatest One Day International batsman of all time. Standard limited overs cricket was introduced in England in the 1963 season in the form of a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England. Limited overs cricket has seen various innovations including the use of multi-coloured kit and floodlit matches using a white ball. A ""one day match"", named so because each match is scheduled for completion in a single day, is the common form of limited overs cricket played on an international level. In practice, matches sometimes continue on a second day if they have been interrupted or postponed by bad weather. The main objective of a limited overs match is to produce a definite result and so a conventional draw is not possible, but matches can be undecided if the scores are tied or if bad weather prevents a result. Each team plays one innings only and faces a limited number of overs, usually a maximum of 50. The Cricket World Cup is held in one day format and the last World Cup in 2015 was won by the co-hosts, Australia. The next World Cup will be hosted by England and Wales in 2019. Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session. The original idea, when the concept was introduced in England in 2003, was to provide workers with an evening entertainment. It was commercially successful and has been adopted internationally. The inaugural Twenty20 World Championship was held in 2007 and won by India. Subsequent events have been held which were won by Pakistan (2009), England (2010), West Indies (2012), and Sri Lanka (2014). The next tournament is scheduled to be held in 2016 . After the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 many domestic Twenty20 leagues were born. First of them was Indian Cricket League which was a rebel league since it was not authorized by BCCI . BCCI then formed its official league called the Indian Premier League . The official league went on to become a successful annual affair that attracted players and audience around the globe, while the Indian Cricket League has been disbanded. After the success of Indian Premier League, many other domestic leagues were formed globally. Recently the Twenty20 Champions League was formed as a tournament for domestic clubs of various countries. In this league, competition is between the top domestic teams from the senior cricketing nations. National championships Main article: First-class cricket Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1895. The team first became County Championship champions in 1893. First-class cricket includes Test cricket but the term is generally used to refer to the highest level of domestic cricket in those countries with full ICC membership, although there are exceptions to this. First-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the County Championship . The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890. The most successful club has been Yorkshire County Cricket Club with 30 official titles. Australia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the Sheffield Shield was introduced. In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states. New South Wales has won the maximum number of titles with 45 to 2008. National championship trophies to be established elsewhere included the Ranji Trophy (India), Plunket Shield (New Zealand), Currie Cup (South Africa) and Shell Shield (West Indies). Some of these competitions have been updated and renamed in recent years. Domestic limited overs competitions began with England's Gillette Cup knockout in 1963. Countries usually stage seasonal limited overs competitions in both knockout and league format. In recent years, national Twenty20 competitions have been introduced, usually in knockout form though some incorporate mini-leagues. Club cricket A typical club cricket match in England. Club cricket is a mainly amateur, but still formal, form of the sport of cricket, usually involving teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening. There is a great deal of variation in game format although the Laws of Cricket are always observed. Club cricket is frequently organised in a league or cup format. Games are limited by either time or overs. Limited overs games usually last between 20 and 60 overs per innings. A less common, but more traditional, format is limiting the game by time only. Games can range from a few hours in the evening to two days long. A modern innovation is the introduction of Twenty20 competitions, both as a format in the existing leagues and new leagues solely based on Twenty20, such as LastManStanding. Standards of play can vary from semi-professional to occasional recreational level and club cricket is often enjoyed as much for the social element as for the competition. Most clubs have their own ground to play on regularly, often including a field and pavilion or club house. An exception being 'Wandering Sides' who use other's grounds. Many leagues have been formed around the world of varying degrees of professionalism, the oldest being the Birmingham & District Premier League in the Birmingham area of England, founded in 1888. Other types of matches Main article: Forms of cricket A game of French cricket in progress in Jervis Bay , Australia There are numerous variations of the sport played throughout the world that include indoor cricket , French cricket , beach cricket , Kwik cricket and all sorts of card games and board games that have been inspired by cricket. In these variants, the rules are often changed to make the game playable with limited resources or to render it more convenient and enjoyable for the participants. Indoor Cricket was first invented in 1970. [40] It is similar to outdoor cricket except that is played in an indoor sports hall with 6 players per team. It is extremely popular in the UK with national championships and multiple independent leagues. Another less formal version of indoor cricket is played in a smaller arena with a soft ball and without pads was invented some years later and is commonly played in the Southern Hemisphere, and even has its own nominal international championships, including World Cups . In the UK, garden cricket is a popular version of the sport, played in gardens and on recreation grounds around the country by adults and children alike. Although a cricket bat and ball are generally used, other equipment such as pads and gloves are not. The exact rules will vary based on the number of participants and the available space. Families and teenagers play backyard cricket or tennis ball cricket in suburban yards or driveways, and the cities of India and Pakistan play host to countless games of "" Gully Cricket "" or "" tape ball "" in their long narrow streets. Sometimes the rules are improvised: e.g. it may be agreed that fielders can catch the ball with one hand after one bounce and claim a wicket; or if only a few people are available then everyone may field while the players take it in turns to bat and bowl. Tennis balls and homemade bats are often used, and a variety of objects may serve as wickets: for example, the batter's legs as in French cricket , which did not in fact originate in France, and is usually played by small children. In Kwik cricket , the bowler does not have to wait for the batsman to be ready before a delivery, leading to a faster, more exhausting game designed to appeal to children, which is often used in physical education lessons at UK schools. Another modification to increase the pace of the game is the ""Tip and Run"", ""Tipity"" Run, ""Tipsy Run"" or ""Tippy-Go"" rule, in which the batter must run when the ball touches the bat, even if it the contact is unintentional or minor. This rule, seen only in impromptu games, speeds the match up by removing the batsman's right to block the ball. In Samoa a form of cricket called Kilikiti is played in which hockey stick -shaped bats are used. In original English cricket, the hockey stick shape was replaced by the modern straight bat in the 1760s after bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it. In Estonia , teams gather over the winter for the annual Ice Cricket tournament. The game juxtaposes the normal summer pursuit with harsh, wintry conditions. Rules are otherwise similar to those for the six-a-side game. International structure Main articles: International structure of cricket , International Cricket Council , and World Cricket League ICC member nations. The (highest level) Test playing nations are shown in orange; the associate member nations are shown in yellow; the affiliate member nations are shown in purple. The International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai , is the international governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989. The ICC has 104 members : 10 Full Members that play official Test matches, 34 Associate Members, and 60 Affiliate Members. [41] The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals. Each nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country. The cricket board also selects the national squad and organises home and away tours for the national team. In the West Indies these matters are addressed by the West Indies Cricket Board which consists of members appointed by four national boards and two multi-national boards. Members Main article: List of International Cricket Council members Full Members Full Members are the governing bodies for cricket in a country or associated countries. Full Members may also represent a geographical area. All Full Members have a right to send one representative team to play official Test matches. Also, all Full Member nations are automatically qualified to play ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals . [42] West Indies cricket team does not represent one country instead an amalgamation of over 20 countries from the Caribbean . The English Cricket team represents both England and Wales.

[45] In 1998, cricket was played as part of the Commonwealth Games , on this occasion in the 50-over format. Twenty20 cricket was under consideration to be part of the 2010 Commonwealth Games , which were held in Delhi , but at the time the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), were not in favour of the short format of the game, and it was not included. [46] Cricket was played in 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China [47] and 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. [48] India skipped both times. [49] There was further calls for subsequent Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games . The Commonwealth Games Federation asked the ICC to participate in the 2014 and 2018 Commonwealth Games , but the ICC turned down the invitation. [50] In 2010, the International Olympic Committee recognised cricket as a sport which could apply to be included in the Olympic Games, [51] but in 2013 the ICC announced that it had no intentions to make such an application, primarily due to opposition from the BCCI . ESPNcricinfo suggested that the opposition might be based on the possible loss of income. In April 2016, ICC chief executive Dave Richardson said that Twenty20 cricket can have a chance of getting in for the 2024 Summer Games , but there must be collective support shown by the ICC's membership base, in particular from BCCI, in order for there to be a chance of inclusion. [52] Statistics Main article: Cricket statistics Organized cricket lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. At the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, one-day internationals, and first-class cricket are recorded separately. However, since Test matches are a form of first-class cricket, a player's first-class statistics will include his Test match statistics – but not vice versa. The Guide to Cricketers was a cricket annual edited by Fred Lillywhite between 1849 and his death in 1866. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was founded in 1864 by the English cricketer John Wisden (1826–1884) as a competitor to The Guide to Cricketers . Its annual publication has continued uninterrupted to the present day, making it the longest running sports annual in history. Certain traditional statistics are familiar to most cricket fans. The basic batting statistics include: Innings (I): The number of innings in which the batsman actually batted. Not outs (NO): The number of times the batsman was not out at the conclusion of an innings they batted in. Runs (R): The number of runs scored. Highest score (HS/Best): The highest score ever made by the batsman. Batting average (Ave): The total number of runs divided by the total number of innings in which the batsman was out. Ave = Runs/[I – NO] (also Avge or Avg.) Centuries (100): The number of innings in which the batsman scored one hundred runs or more. Half-centuries (50): The number of innings in which the batsman scored fifty to ninety-nine runs (centuries do not count as half-centuries as well). Balls faced (BF): The total number of balls received, including no balls but not including wides. Strike rate (SR): The number of runs scored per 100 balls faced. (SR = [100 * Runs]/BF) Run rate (RR): Is the number of runs a batsman (or the batting side) scores in an over of six balls. The basic bowling statistics include: Overs (O): The number of overs bowled. Balls (B): The number of balls bowled. Overs is more traditional, but balls is a more useful statistic because the number of balls per over has varied historically. Maiden overs (M): The number of maiden overs (overs in which the bowler conceded zero runs) bowled. Runs (R): The number of runs conceded. Wickets (W): The number of wickets taken. No balls (Nb): The number of no balls bowled. Wides (Wd): The number of wides bowled. Bowling average (Ave): The average number of runs conceded per wicket. (Ave = Runs/W) Strike rate (SR): The average number of balls bowled per wicket. (SR = Balls/W) Economy rate (Econ): The average number of runs conceded per over . (Econ = Runs/overs bowled). Scorecards See also: Scoring (cricket) A match's statistics are summarised on a scorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks . The earliest known scorecards were printed in 1776 by Pratt, scorer to the Sevenoaks Vine Cricket Club, but it was many years before his invention was widely adopted. [53] Scorecards were printed and sold at Lord's for the first time in 1846. [54] The introduction of scoreboards revolutionised cricket by allowing spectators to keep track of the day's play. In 1848, Fred Lillywhite used a portable printing press at grounds to print updated scorecards. In 1858, the Kennington Oval introduced the first mobile scorebox, ""a house on rollers with figures for telegraphing on each side"". In 1881, the Melbourne Cricket Ground erected the first cricket scoreboard. The scoreboard, located at the western end of the ground, gave the batsman's name and method of dismissal. [53] Culture Influence on everyday life Impromptu game of cricket in Sydney , Australia Cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere. Cricket has had an influence on the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with such phrases as ""going all out"", ""that's not cricket"" (unfair), ""had a good innings "", "" sticky wicket "", and ""bowled over"". There have been many cricket films . The term ""Bradmanesque"" from Don Bradman's name has become a generic term for outstanding excellence, both within cricket and in the wider world. [55] The amateur game has also been spread further afield by expatriates from the Test-playing nations. In the arts and popular culture See also: Cricket in fiction Cricket is the subject of works by noted English poets, including William Blake and Lord Byron . [56] Beyond a Boundary (1963), written by Trinidadian C.L.R. James , is often named the best book on any sport, ever written. [57] In fiction, there is English author P. G. Wodehouse 's 1909 novel, Mike . In the visual arts, notable cricket paintings include Albert Chevallier Tayler 's Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury (1907) and Russell Drysdale 's The Cricketers (1948), which has been called ""possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century."" [58] French impressionist Camille Pissarro painted cricket on a visit to England in the 1890s. [56] Francis Bacon , an avid cricket fan, captured a batsman in motion. [56] Caribbean artist Wendy Nanan 's cricket images [59] are featured in a limited edition first day cover for Royal Mail 's ""World of Invention"" stamp issue, [60] celebrating the London Cricket Conference 1–3 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the celebrations leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup . There are many cricket video games , including EA Sports Cricket 07 . [61] Influence on other sports Tom Wills , cricketer and co-founder of Australian football Cricket has close historical ties with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports . [62] In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a ""foot-ball club"" with ""a code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season. The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game. [63] It is typically played on modified cricket fields . In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn , New York, was responsible for the ""development of the box score , tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average , and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball "". [64] The statistical record is so central to the game's ""historical essence"" that Chadwick came to be known as Father of Baseball, and was an early inductee in the Baseball Hall of Fame .

Aaron Finch smashed 137 off 109 balls with 11 fours and six sixes while Travis Head , reprieved on 60, made an unbeaten 85 to help Australia overhaul 318 with two balls to spare. The victory would be that much sweeter to the Australians, even though this was only a precursor to the main tournament, as it came without their captain Steven Smith and frontline fast bowler Mitchell Starc, who were both rested. All this meant Angelo Mathews ' 95, which underlined his importance in Sri Lanka's starting XI, went in vain. Mathews, playing his first competitive match for his country after a four-month layoff due to a hamstring injury, did bulk of the damage in allrounder Asela Gunaratne's company. The pair added 91 in 92 balls to offset Sri Lankans' middle order woes; they had been reduced to 152 for 5 in 28 overs. Mathews, who walked in at 71 for 3 in the 12th over, began cautiously - taking 77 balls to get to his half-century - before cutting lose in the end overs. His innings ended when he holed out to Adam Zampa in the 44th over. Gunaratne then took seamer Josh Hazlewood for three sixes and a four in the penultimate over. He was well supported by legspinning allrounder Seekkuge Prasanna, who hit 31 off 19 balls, as Sri Lankans took 57 off the last five overs. The Australians started their chase in a sedate manner but Finch's blitz soon helped them take control. The opener raised his century off just 76 balls with a six off Gunaratne. He added 75 with Head before Nuwan Pradeep gave his side hope by getting rid of Finch and Glenn Maxwell off successive deliveries. But reprieving Head on 60 with Australia needing 21 off 15 proved costly in the end for Sri Lankans, who will play New Zealanders at Edgbaston on May 30 © ESPN Sports Media Ltd.

Log Out characters left LATEST ALL 104 OLDEST Modern-Spectator on May 28, 2017, 0:19 GMT Reality, both SA / Ind seems making +370 against weak SL bowling. Points to ponder: 1) Make batting more aggressive with KJP replacing Chandi. 2) KM will bounce back but should not send in power play if openers (ND & UT) fall early. 3) Captaincy duties should be split into two. Mathew's major role to be public spoke person for SL team which he is very good at. But strategy (field setting and bowling changes) should be handled primarily by UT's intuition. Otherwise, it will be 0-3 and time for Malinga to retire from ODI. 4) Heavy underdog SL should adopt spoiler role even in group stage. Use offensive fielding to get wickets rather than Mathew's defensive fielding to guard runs. 6) Each SL bowler should come up with his aggressive fielding strategies for his bowling variations rather than burdening the captain to set field. 4) If SL field first, substitute ND's wicket keeping duties with KJP around 35th over to rest ND for batting. 7) To next warm up game, please rest Malinga. Herath-UK on May 27, 2017, 20:59 GMT @ cricfan6589099020, that is the advantage, he can be used as a floating batsman, to be used as necessary to the situation, if a wicket falls first over or two as an opener or otherwise. The difference is he can score big (as a proper batsman) than a few quick runs scored at the death with the same number of overs bowled as Prasanna. He is taller & could take the advantage on that account too. Nothing against Prasanna who is wonderful but looking for a short term measure. See all these current games score above 320 & we fall short of a proper batsman most of the time. Out of the current frontline batsmen, Mendis Chandimal,UT & Kapu have nothing else. First two are long term prospects so either Kapu or UT should be dropped before long for another good batsman who can bowl a good few overs. Otherwise our team cannot be balanced properly. UT or Kapu has to play a consistent long innings to remain in the team. cricfan6589099020 on May 27, 2017, 20:10 GMT @Herath-UK And where exactly will dhanushka bat? We already have 3 openers .. Do we need to make that 4? Plus he haven't been in good form ... I think prasanna is also one of the better fielders in the squad and he can provide some powe hitting at the death ;which dhanushka is unable to provide Herath-UK on May 27, 2017, 19:26 GMT Prasanna bowled only five overs for 35 runs. Why can't he be replaced by Danuhka Gunatilaka who can bowl those few overs albeit a few more runs given but he is a good batsman & a good fielder. Any ideas, why not? Over to the selectors. Deepfreezed on May 27, 2017, 18:04 GMT SL hands are tied, they cannot drop Sandakan. There are no other spinners other than the part-time lollipops. SLC should have thought about that before. Need a spinner to break the pace. It's time to get Jeff V going. He will be expensive but in modern cricket we need to get the batters out somehow. There is no way of containing. FedupSL on May 27, 2017, 16:45 GMT An eye-opener for all those blind worshipers of KJP... who are demanding the neck of poor K Mendis or UT again (3+ yrs of UT's prime career was already ruined since 28 yrs to accommodate this 10 ball -Master of S>D> KJP who ended up wasting almost 50 % of his 65 odi chances to doom SL with <10 ball gate-openings : 30 odis - 105 runs @ 3.88 Average - 51 SR - 9 HS).

Am I dreaming? cricfan82865468 on May 27, 2017, 14:54 GMT When Mendis has 100, 50, 10 or so in last 3 innings who is mut who wants him dropped? Chandi is also playing well. Modern-Spectator on May 28, 2017, 0:19 GMT Reality, both SA / Ind seems making +370 against weak SL bowling. Points to ponder: 1) Make batting more aggressive with KJP replacing Chandi. 2) KM will bounce back but should not send in power play if openers (ND & UT) fall early. 3) Captaincy duties should be split into two. Mathew's major role to be public spoke person for SL team which he is very good at. But strategy (field setting and bowling changes) should be handled primarily by UT's intuition. Otherwise, it will be 0-3 and time for Malinga to retire from ODI. 4) Heavy underdog SL should adopt spoiler role even in group stage. Use offensive fielding to get wickets rather than Mathew's defensive fielding to guard runs. 6) Each SL bowler should come up with his aggressive fielding strategies for his bowling variations rather than burdening the captain to set field. 4) If SL field first, substitute ND's wicket keeping duties with KJP around 35th over to rest ND for batting. 7) To next warm up game, please rest Malinga. Herath-UK on May 27, 2017, 20:59 GMT @ cricfan6589099020, that is the advantage, he can be used as a floating batsman, to be used as necessary to the situation, if a wicket falls first over or two as an opener or otherwise. The difference is he can score big (as a proper batsman) than a few quick runs scored at the death with the same number of overs bowled as Prasanna. He is taller & could take the advantage on that account too. Nothing against Prasanna who is wonderful but looking for a short term measure. See all these current games score above 320 & we fall short of a proper batsman most of the time. Out of the current frontline batsmen, Mendis Chandimal,UT & Kapu have nothing else. First two are long term prospects so either Kapu or UT should be dropped before long for another good batsman who can bowl a good few overs. Otherwise our team cannot be balanced properly. UT or Kapu has to play a consistent long innings to remain in the team. cricfan6589099020 on May 27, 2017, 20:10 GMT @Herath-UK And where exactly will dhanushka bat? We already have 3 openers .. Do we need to make that 4? Plus he haven't been in good form ... I think prasanna is also one of the better fielders in the squad and he can provide some powe hitting at the death ;which dhanushka is unable to provide Herath-UK on May 27, 2017, 19:26 GMT Prasanna bowled only five overs for 35 runs. Why can't he be replaced by Danuhka Gunatilaka who can bowl those few overs albeit a few more runs given but he is a good batsman & a good fielder. Any ideas, why not? Over to the selectors. Deepfreezed on May 27, 2017, 18:04 GMT SL hands are tied, they cannot drop Sandakan. There are no other spinners other than the part-time lollipops. SLC should have thought about that before. Need a spinner to break the pace. It's time to get Jeff V going. He will be expensive but in modern cricket we need to get the batters out somehow. There is no way of containing. FedupSL on May 27, 2017, 16:45 GMT An eye-opener for all those blind worshipers of KJP... who are demanding the neck of poor K Mendis or UT again (3+ yrs of UT's prime career was already ruined since 28 yrs to accommodate this 10 ball -Master of S>D> KJP who ended up wasting almost 50 % of his 65 odi chances to doom SL with <10 ball gate-openings : 30 odis - 105 runs @ 3.88 Average - 51 SR - 9 HS).

No other way. Kusal, Chandimal, Mathews, Kapu, Gune, Malinga, Pradeep, Lakmal, Sandakan shud play all matches, now where is a place for Thisara and Sekkuge? Selectors are having positive matters after so many years. Herath-UK on May 27, 2017, 14:39 GMT What is important is players who are certain to play like Dickwella & Kapu to get the responsibility to go to score big. These two have not made a substantial score to my knowledge & scoring a fast 40/50 won't make you great.Mendis Asela & Mathews have shown they can do it on their day.Even Kusal P has shown it. Tharanga & Chandimal though have done in the past have to show that they belong to the present day league consistent with current format .Hope dearly these two will show their class against SA. Kadmin on May 27, 2017, 14:24 GMT What I think we should get KJP in for Chandimal. Let's test him in that position. Guy has matured now the way his inning handles. Test him in the next warm-up match. My preferred lineup - UT, Dickwella, KM, KJP/Chandimal, AM, Kapu/AG, Seekuge/Thisara, Sandakan, Malinga, Kula/Pradeep, Lakmal cricfan5481389038 on May 27, 2017, 13:54 GMT Sl can win ct2017, if manage players and rotate players at places they should play cricfan5481389038 on May 27, 2017, 13:15 GMT Dickwella, tharanga, Kusal perera, Kusal mendis, asela, Mathews, kapu, prasanna, lakmal,malinga,pradeep Dropped :- sandakan,chandi,kule,thisara Invermay on May 27, 2017, 13:08 GMT Sri lanka are moaning about their poor fielding BUT they still persist with 'Sauthu' Tharanga ( dropped 3 sitters in SA & australia which cost the team over 300 runs) in place of a brilliant fielder in Dhanushka Gunatilleke-who is also a good bat and a more than useful off spinner. He saves at least 20 runs in the field. Prasanna also should play for his fielding and batting even if Sandakan plays.We have some good players BUT the team selection is VERY POOR.Prasanna & Gunatilleke will add that much needed zip into the side Cricinfouser on May 27, 2017, 12:54 GMT @NIMESH RANDIKA - Not sure if I complete agree with that, but I never used the term ""specialist"". The idea of a ""specialist"" in a format is far from what I was suggesting. My main idea was that it is too soon for Mendis to play in the first 11 at this particular tournament and that if he performed less than expected, SL fans and selectors will lose confidence in him, and worst of all, him losing confidence in himself. If it comes down to this, we may never see what he could achieve. This has happened to a few good young players in Sri Lanka, the latest examples are Dhananjaya de Silva and Sandun Weerakkody (dropped into a critical match before 24 hours landing in a strange country). Another is UT who was judged out based on his strike rate and T20 performance. The numbers show how badly our camp mismanaged players (it was 40 something different players rotated during a specific period--a number far from any other country). cricfan5481389038 on May 27, 2017, 12:35 GMT The best player for no:- 5 is asela because he is a slow starter but he is a good finisher, he can build a inning in middle overs, he can be the anchor if lost early wickets, 6 Mathews, 7 kapugedara. good finishers Engee on May 27, 2017, 12:23 GMT SL should be pleased with this outing..Kula needs to step up if he is going to play the containing role! Ravi Randeniya on May 27, 2017, 12:09 GMT Dumb leadership by Mathews.....changing bowlers when required was never among his strengths. cricfan5481389038 on May 27, 2017, 11:26 GMT Look at no3 and 4 in every best sides in the world. If needed they can open the inning. Just look at our past success team, 1 sanath 2 tharanga 3 sanga 4 mahela, as i said sanga had open the inning and mahela also, so we need 1 player at no 4 Kusal mendis or chandimal, we have to select only one player because both are slow starters, Kusal mendis is better player than chandimal... the best is 1 dickwella,2 ut, 3 kjp, 4 kusal or chandi Sheldon#That'smyspot on May 27, 2017, 10:46 GMT I bet Mathews didn't wanna break Malinga down with another injury. Keep in mind he's coming from bowling 4 overs in a game in the IPL, that too with two-over spells. So Malinga bowling just 8 overs is not really anything to take away from a great Aussie chase. Mathews hitting form bodes good signs for Sri Lanka and Gunaratne is just a magnificent find isn't he? At a time when hit or miss players like Chandimal get free rides in the squad. Hopefully Malinga will come back to his usual self in the tournament. I might get hung for this, but i have to say given recent form KJP deserves a shot, at the expense of Chandimal/Kapu maybe midway in the tournament if one of them keeps failing. Nimesh Randika on May 27, 2017, 10:29 GMT @CRICINFOUSER , There is no such a thing as a specialist ODI player and specialist Test player, any specialist batsmen should be able to play in both format. I see this categorization only in SL ( mainly to hide the inability of their favorite players ).for an example just look at the younger players in BD ,both Mossadek , Sabbir ( lot less experience than Mendis) playing well in both format . Its only SL which is struggling to find a quality young player who can play in the International level. armchair_critic007 on May 27, 2017, 10:24 GMT Serious question - is sanath in a fit state to make team selections for such a big tournament in light of a recent embarrasing incident. Hope he takes it on the chin and gets over it cricfan5481389038 on May 27, 2017, 10:21 GMT 7 batsmen including who can ball few overs like anje,asela,prassanna,thisara and 4 main ballers R_U_4_REAL_NICK on May 27, 2017, 10:04 GMT I can't for the life of me understand why Sri Lanka didn't bowl out Malinga, and persisted with expensive bowlers at the death. Just a warm up I know, but some of the tactics throughout the game were just bizarre. The usual Australian fans harping on about the pitch again as an excuse for why their quicks weren't as penetrative as hyped up to be. Get this into your heads guys: just as sure as the sun will rise in the East and set in the West here in UK, so too can you be sure that here in UK has- and probably never will be- a fast-bowlers paradise. Our climate and pitch conditions are generally best for swing/seam bowling, not 'all-brawn-and-no-brains-style' fast bowling. My advice to fast bowlers would be to work and concentrate on finding lovely (late) movement through the air, and seam off the pitches (unless you have a Malinga-like yorker!). Fast, straight bowling here in UK leaks easy runs. Cricinfouser on May 27, 2017, 9:38 GMT @SAJITHAD - I truly wish you're right about Mendis inclusion in the tournament (for SL hopefully going a long way), but I doubt it will be the case in the next few weeks. I found his and Dhan. de Silva's integration (in T20s and ODIs) to be too quick. Both should have been given another year or so of playing abroad experience, than shoving one into a battle for a world title. It may be too conservative, but I think replacing either him or Chandimal with Kusal is a better gamble since Kusal is in better form. Herath-UK on May 27, 2017, 9:21 GMT We should not get into camps to get the favourite player. There are only three games & out of that the very first game against SA very important. Out of all the three games Tharanga played so far, he did not score a single fifty whereas Kusal P did in his only game. We need to put the one in form to the first game.if still doubtful,start the game against NZ with Kusal P & Tharanga & find the one in form. cricfan5481389038 on May 27, 2017, 9:20 GMT Kusal mendis is better batsman than chandimal, but at no 3 we need a batsman who can score fast, ut is a best batsman who can score big, dickwella and ut is the best openers, Kusal must play at no 3, Kusal mendis no 4, we have to drop chandimal for Kusal janith, kulasekara for lakmal, if we had a good spinner we can drop sandakan cricfan5481389038 on May 27, 2017, 9:08 GMT Problem is why we got 3 openers, in the squad if one player got injured we can bring some one from sri Lanka, we need another good spinner like pushpakumara or akila cricfan6333045728 on May 27, 2017, 8:31 GMT Yes, I totally agree with the comments of one of the writers, that Kusal Mendis, the most talented of our batsmen, should only be reserved for Test Cricket. Let him not ruin his orthodox stroke making to trying to hit out in ODI's and T20's. Can't Ford and the likes of Sanath see this? cricfan6333045728 on May 27, 2017, 8:22 GMT Well done to Sri Lanka in making a valiant effort over Australia. The latter are a formidable team in spite of resting their Captain Smith & and their best bowler, Starc. Torontoman on May 27, 2017, 7:53 GMT Kusal Mendis wasting his oportunities , very sad his talent goes from to bottom nowadays Jass Jayasinghe on May 27, 2017, 7:34 GMT My side for next match: 1. Dikwella 2. KJP 3. Upul 4. Asela 5. Mathiws 6. Kapu 7. Thisara 8. Sekku 9. Malinga 10. Lakmal 11. Pradeep SajithaD on May 27, 2017, 7:27 GMT Can't understand why people asking kusal mendis to be removed. Only played 25 matches, average - 36, strike rate 85, last two ODI innings are 102 and 54. One warm up match failure made him a bad ODI player, really? Agreed to the logic with pressure situation failure for youngsters, that could be the reason for sadeera samarawikrama, nipun ransika, asitha fernando are not selected instead of kusal janith, upul tharanga, kulasekara and nuwan pradeep. But this guy is different, he was an under 19 captain. Kusal mendis was there to hold the gate in new zealand, south africa when openers gone for single digits very often in test matches, and to build innings after first 3 wickets in ODI's. Has gone through tense situations against stark and co. in tests, and taken team to home against WI in tri-series final, calm the situation against bangladesh. He only failed in t20s. I think this guy already passed the stress test. He will play a big inning in atleast one match in group stage. Mervo on May 27, 2017, 6:42 GMT Maxwell made his usual Golden Duck. Not sure Australia is very focussed on this tournament with their major dispute with CA. It will tell. Cricinfouser on May 27, 2017, 6:14 GMT @NIMESH RANDIKA - Mendis and recently dropped Dhanahjaya de Silva are extremely talented young players who should be playing test, not in the shorter formats. Their poor performance under pressure in big tournaments is giving fans nothing but a negative feeling about their future. Examples of bad management of players amongst many. GoodAreasShane on May 27, 2017, 6:11 GMT Australia has some room for improvement, especially with the bowling, but that is exactly what warm up games are for. By the time our first game comes around Australia will be ready. realcricket96 on May 27, 2017, 5:58 GMT Asela should be played at 4 in batting order...because he has a ability to play big role..and he needs some time to settle and he is good finisher like a mathews...chandimal and mendise are not consistent players and waisting their opportunities and also deliveries...1 dikwella 2 upul 3 chandi/mendies 4 asela 5 mathew 6 kapu 7 seekuge/thisara 8 kulasekara/pradeep 9 suranga lakmal 10 malinga 11 sadakan Nimesh Randika on May 27, 2017, 5:57 GMT Mendis is turning out to be another disappointment for the SLC in search for the young talent Cricinfouser on May 27, 2017, 5:44 GMT This is Australia's C team the fact is if they play Smith and starc also then their team is also third string team in front of eng nz SA Ind.hahahahhahahah Ranilfdo on May 27, 2017, 5:22 GMT Some comments here are funny. This is a warm up game and both teams warmed up for the tournament well. Winning the match is not the idea of a warm up game. There are concerns about our bowling strength since the selection of the squad. Kulasekara is not a threat to any international batsman now with his speed & with that speed his slower ball is useless. I don't expect this pathetic Sri Lankan team with the worst ever Sri Lankan captain Mathews to win a single game in this Champions Trophy. srcric on May 27, 2017, 5:00 GMT This team is good.strong with malinga and mathews inclusions.dick wella should open with tharanga.if dick wella fails kjp should replace him,but not tharanga.kjp is kind of blind hitter.but tharanga is not.opening pair should be a mixture of power hitting and patience. chandimasl on May 27, 2017, 5:00 GMT I am a fan of KJP but I dont think he should be replaced with Mendis.KJP should be given a chance in the next warm up game and see his performance.He is very inconsistent and has a horrible record in England soil.But my worry is Sandakan.He wont be effective against India. ajmaldubai on May 27, 2017, 5:00 GMT Agree with the heading. If it is not belongs to Travis Head. Of course, his contribution was good but Finch was the one who made a strong basement for others to achieve the target and Head did with the fine finish. After Vash and Murali retirement, Srilankans are struggling to find Ace bowler for both pace and spin though they are having few likes of Lakmal, Pradeep etc, who are not regular performers. When talking about this match, Aussies are utilised underperform bowlers and won the match. Whereas If it was another team like England, Southafrica, India, the result would have been in different. Wait and see the performance of Aussie in this Champions Trophy. cricfan68626308 on May 27, 2017, 4:56 GMT My Team 1.Tharanga 2.Dikwella 3.Chandimal 4.K.Perera/K.Mendis 5.Mathews 6.Kapu 7.Asela 8.Prasanna/Sandakan 9.Kulasekara 10.Malinga 11.Pradeep Plz Send chandimal no.03 if first wicket fall inside in the first 10 overs.because Mendis is wasting so many deliveries and put the pressure on the next batsmen.Chandimal is an experienced batsman and he should be the anchor of the innings. Jose...P on May 27, 2017, 4:24 GMT Headlines say: Cool Head breaks Australia's 319 chase. Cool heads always help, even if doesn't belong to Travis. Perhaps, Kohli may want to note, though it has nothing to do with his 'cricketing' skills, per se, which is of the highest order, despite hitches here & there! Or, on rare occasions. Cool head could be invaluable, when he is the captain, and is still on a voyage to prove beyond India's shores, in spite of whatever he says, or most of us among the fans say. Good luck to our man. This comment, though looking out of place here, is triggered by the headlines. SarathMendis on May 27, 2017, 4:21 GMT SL should remember to use power play overs even one opener out. I suggest to send tailenders like Kulasekara or Pressana if one opener out during power play. Dhawala05 on May 27, 2017, 4:13 GMT In the next warm up against NZ SL will play Kusal Perera and Lakmal so then they will decide the xi for the first match SLC future is going to be bright But to win the CT Tharanga Kulesekara and Kapugedera need to play well Good luck boys make it to the semifinal first TheBigBoodha on May 27, 2017, 4:08 GMT The pitch seemed quite spongey, which is probably why the medium pacers did better than the quicks. Hope we don't get too many pitches like this. Would be nice to see fast bowlers being given something up front. Hope Pattinson learns how to bowl in 50 over games. He always looks ordinary in this format, which is strange, given his record in the long format is outstanding. PRAVEENCRICKET14 on May 27, 2017, 4:00 GMT They have two similar players in Kusal Mendis and Chandimal batting at 3 and 4. If they continue this in the actual matches, it is going to bite them. cricket_first_priority on May 27, 2017, 3:53 GMT SL really miss Dhammika Prasad. Hard hitting batter and strike bowler too. Hopefully he will come back from his injury soon. The problem is if we play Pradeep and Malinga, our #9 will have to be a frontline spinner who can bat a little, leaving Prasanna as the only option (versus Sandakan). Prasanna is perfect for t20 but his bowling is not good enough for 10 overs. SL_Fan_5 on May 27, 2017, 3:48 GMT First game is SA and Tharanga should play it. Rather drop Mendis. KJP has been a little more consistent than before and for us to have any chance of getting to the second round, we rather take the risk of him getting a 60-70 in one match than some one getting 30-40 in each 3. SL_Fan_5 on May 27, 2017, 3:42 GMT Guys I know Kule has lost some steam but if there is any swing we need to play him. After Makinga he is the next best death bowler we brought. After the next game we need to make a call. KJP can replace a few players. The amount of balls Mendis used puts the next bstsmen under pressure. Need to rotate and bat at least at 50% for the first 2 overs. He is a natural stroke maker, I think the coaching team is trying curb him just like they did with Chandimal. Must say that Chandi has improved a bit. Royal_Thora on May 27, 2017, 3:24 GMT Our bowling is a big concern. Kula did the job for us in the past, but seems to be he is expired. My team is 1)Niroshan 2)UT 3)Kusal Mendis 4)Chandimal 5)Angelo 6)Kapu 7)Asela 8)Prasanna/Lakmal 9)Pradeep 10)Lakshan 11)Malinga. Death bowling is the biggest issue, hopefully Pradeep can do the job. People have suggested to replace Kusal Mendis with KJP. Even though I am big fan of KJP, he should not replace Mendis. Mendis is our future, KJP should only be used to replace UT. UT needs to raise his game by big time, he is putting additional pressure on Niroshan. All the best SL!!! chandimasl on May 27, 2017, 3:13 GMT Not having an attacking spinner to control the innings was highlighted here.Sandakan was so inconsistent.I wonder why Mathews consider him as a mystry spinner. cluelessjan1 on May 27, 2017, 3:04 GMT i am also for lakmal for kule. on batting SL need to pursue with mendis and chandi. may be kjp for upul. SLC_OBSERVER on May 27, 2017, 2:52 GMT Drop Mendis and bring in Kusal Perera. That should fix the batting lineup. Drop kula and bring in Lakaml BRADMANBESTEVER on May 27, 2017, 2:46 GMT Close game so sides are even. Why Stoinis batted so low is a mystery to me - he should bat above Henriques. Good to see Head finally doing something significant. Cricinfouser on May 27, 2017, 2:44 GMT If there will be accurate pitches, we must get KJP in and drop either Mendis or Chandi. Judging by the recent past in this format, both are out of form. sl_supporter on May 27, 2017, 2:29 GMT Kula and Kusal Mendis shouldn't be in the playing 11 for SL to have any hope in this tournament. Kula had no pace in his bowling and Mendis is very inconsistent. crzcric on May 27, 2017, 2:18 GMT Chandimal played only 22 balls and you see SL scored 318. If he played his normal knock SL would have stuck in 270s. Still SL top order needs to convert their starts to big scores.from the predicted pitch reports any thing less than 330 will be difficult to defend. Finch showed how modern ODIs should be played and importance of playing aggressively in middle overs. SL bowling is also a big concern if kula, sankan can't bowl economically. cluelessjan1 on May 27, 2017, 2:16 GMT this is a good performance from SL for a warm up game. good to see malinga bowling 8 good overs and captain among the runs. watch kapu, feel he is going to have a good one. realcricket96 on May 27, 2017, 2:13 GMT Both teams well played...some comments made me funny.. AUS C team???don't kidding us..Wanner, finch,maxxi,head,cummins,lynn,wade,hazelwood,henrqe and all batting strength were here...only missed smith.. cricketsubh on May 27, 2017, 2:08 GMT Head finch play well but Lyne stoinis Maxwell struggle 11 .warner.finch.smith.head.Henrique's.wade.Hastings.stark.Cummins.hezalwood.coulterNile.hastings Cummins stark coulterNile can bat AuslankaIndia99 on May 27, 2017, 2:08 GMT Since this was a warm up match there is no such things as playing 11. Australia did the smart thing by using all their batting power including Stoinis when chasing so AUS used total of 12 players (excluding starc, Hastings and smith) throughout that game whereas SL was too defensive at the middle and why send prasanna when there was Kusal Perera that's not smart. And I hope Kulasekara retires after this tourney so we can bring young pacers like chameera and vikum Sanjay (also lahiru Kumara). Jose...P on May 27, 2017, 2:05 GMT After reading the report on the pitches for this CT, I feel, the lack of pacer-allrounders will not be a major debilitating factor. Nowadays, for most teams, almost all the bowlers can wield the bat to a fairly decent level on any pitch. And, even more so on pure batting tracks. There are Ashwins, Jadejas, Starcs, Cummins and the lot - to name a few from just two teams. That much allroundedness may more than suffice on these tracks. (BTW, I am not going by the past records, but by what they have been showing in recent times) Yet, having someone of the calibre of Ben Stokes provide a distinct advantage. Let me stress, there a few more around the world, but Ben's name was mentioned just as an example... Philthysledger on May 27, 2017, 1:59 GMT I think that has solved the debate over who should open with Warner... Dhawala05 on May 27, 2017, 1:58 GMT Well played SL they done really well to keep AUS in a competitive game Nimesh Randika on May 27, 2017, 1:53 GMT SL cannot defend any total without having bowlers , Mathews and Kulasekara should not bowl their lollipop type slow medium pacers . armchair_critic007 on May 27, 2017, 1:51 GMT Guys advocating playing kusaal p . We can all agree that if he fires we might get 300. But how often does he fire ?? He rarely passes 50 ( that too mostle vs weak teams) , he scores 1 every 7 in innings or so but most concerning is that the 6 or so he doesnt score are adject failuires. Many of them first over didmisssals which maje the rest have to consolidate if the other opener gets out too. Then BOOM , powerplay is gone. It has happened many many times. He has a mediocre average and his average in england is shameful for an opener. There is no point having him get out in the first ovrr and play the game with 10 people. He is the SINGLE DIGIT master of our times as UT fan would say, this tournament has only 3 initial games, i highly doubt he would score in even one, this being england and all. Yes on his once in a blue moon day he can turn a 280 to a 310 but more often that not he turns 280's to 250's . An attacking opener is what SL need but it has to be someone who can bat 10 overs Kadmin on May 27, 2017, 1:49 GMT It's a good practice match and I wouldn't read too much into results. However SL needs to iron out the bowling strategies and fielding. I think the idea was to give everyone a chance on the field. Take al the positives from this game and give some exposure to bench players too. @clean_game mate you can take positives from any game. You have noted your positives because it wasn't the best display from aus. They were expecting to steamroll sl but they couldn't. If I were you I would be more concerned about form of other players. TheRealMvp•_• on May 27, 2017, 1:41 GMT @cricfan1796336579 , C team means- the third best team. Also meaning that 22 better players didnt play .ONLY smith and starc didnt play. How can you call that a C team.Have you even watched cricket to know what a C team is?? Also marsh is DROPPED , not rested , Australia left out merely 2 of their top players. TheRealMvp•_• on May 27, 2017, 1:39 GMT Also malinga has the best economy by far and he removed wade , were you expecting him to get 5 wickets per game? I geel he's done well on his comeback. He bowled tight to finch too, abd regarding cummins not bowling at the end, even SL didnt bowl theur most economical 2 bowlers on the day at the end. So its the same. We tried kule and he git smoked TheRealMvp•_• on May 27, 2017, 1:36 GMT I agree about the bowlers @clean_ganme , but are you sayig that cummins,pattinson,hazlewood,zampa and co are ordinary bowlers? . They are only missing starc Ashuking20 on May 27, 2017, 1:15 GMT can any one tell me why chameera was not selected? clean_game on May 27, 2017, 0:22 GMT @SL_Fan_5 : Sorry mate, I do not know what positives you're talking about. Except Angie, there is no positives but then it is not positive since Angie plays always according to situation and a class player. Malinga bowled 8 overs for a solitary wicket of a lower order batsman. Other bowlers did not chip. Are you talking about Dickwella, Asela and Prasanna?? Prasanna is miss and hit as you know. Dickwella, well if Starc was bowling I am not sure what he would have scored. Asela is always good against ordinary bowling. With quality bowlers, he is going to face from next week, we can see whether he is good enough. Remember, he all his good knocks so far against the average bowlers. clean_game on May 27, 2017, 0:13 GMT Good show from Aussies. SL plyed full strength team along with Malinga who was just able to get a solitary wicket of lower order bat Wade. Smithy and Starcy did not played but still SL could not grab the opportunity. SL late order runs came mainly off Pattison and Hazelwood but in the coming matches if Smithy prefers Starcy and Cummins in those overs, I do not think SL take even think of later order surge. I would have selected Faulkner in place of Pattison which will also boost the batting. amuni12 on May 27, 2017, 0:12 GMT It does not look like Mendis is in form. May want to consider KJP instead. KJP and Dickwella could open. Cricinfouser on May 26, 2017, 23:44 GMT Very well played but SL. Only thing they need to docs on is their bowling. Kulasekera has struggled. I think its best to try Kumara for the NZ match. Kumara was first selected for his great performance for the u19 team playing in England, so it's only fair that he deserves another chance. Jose...P on May 26, 2017, 23:35 GMT First thing: Being a practice match, can't read too much into it. Even though, couldn't watch it on TV, still followed it. After my friend Dunger.Bob supporting the case of Travis for selection, sometimes last year, I had been closely following his game for a while. Have to confess, though he is good, didn't impress me that much so far. Now, happy to see he justifying my friend's judgement. Hope he sustains it and show his worth in this tourney. Though OZ has a few seamer all rounders, (retired Watto with divided views on the younger Marsh & waning Faulkner), I really wanted to see some more spinning all rounders, other than Maxi. This is more so after Smith turned out to be a 'full-time' batsman. (Globally, pitches are conspiring against sheer pace, it seems) So, if Travis shows his skills in both batting & bowling, it will be a nice thing to note. cricfan1796336579 on May 26, 2017, 23:06 GMT SL lost to Aus C team. Aussies played without Smith, Starc, Marsh. SL bowling is a weak link recently. Their bowlers are going to be smashed in CT except for Malinga if he is in form. shanil1984 on May 26, 2017, 22:50 GMT Second string Australian side? My foot. Granted Starc and Smith were MIA but come on, that side was packed with experience - test quality bowlers plenty of big hitters - Warner, Finch, Maxwell, Head and Stoinis.... shanil1984 on May 26, 2017, 22:47 GMT A great practice match for both teams I reckon. Australia's bowling was under strength without Starc. Meanwhile Sri Lanka's batting is in much better shape than it has been. It's tbe bowling and fielding that is still a bit under cooked. Fingers crossed, good to see the Lankies putting up a good fight pre tournament cricfan0508810874 on May 26, 2017, 22:06 GMT 1. Finch 2. Warner 3. Smith 4. Maxi 5. Head 6. Stoinis 7. Wade 8. Starc 9. Hazlewood 10. Cummins 11. Zampa...This I think should be the 11...Stoinis vs Henriques will be an important decision, I guess Stoinis is a better bat in ODIs and Henriques the better bowler...Head vs Lynn is another battle, I think Head edges out in being a more compact batsman and also a part-time bowling option for 2-3 over ...The other option of playing both Lynn and Head and dropping Maxi is not a good option I think, or playing both Henriques and Stoinis and leaving out Maxi for that matter..Would like to see what Australian fans think should be the first choice 11... KingOwl on May 26, 2017, 21:54 GMT This was an encouraging performance from SL. About time too! As I have said all along, SL has the batting to match anybody. The problem is the bowling. Malinga looked fine and didn't go for runs. Pradeep has habit of taking wickets. Kule is a problem. He is good when all the stars align. But can we depend on such alignments in a short tournament? That is the problem. I think SL needs a more reliable fast bowler than Kule. Sandakan takes wickets, but he is really expensive. Can we afford such an expensive spinner? Playing him will be a gamble, I think. But there is any other option, is there? On the batting side, we need at least one accumulator at the top. Mendis can be that person. Upul Tharanga hasn't done badly to be dropped. Kusal Perera hasn't done anything outstanding to be included. I think SL should stick to UT. He can make quick runs with orthodox play. Middle order is reasonable, not great. So the top has to perform. Herath-UK on May 26, 2017, 21:48 GMT My earlier comment was to open with Dickwella & Kusal P. We need a good burst up front, a score more than 320 I said & it proved today. For the warm up game against NZ, open with Kusal P & Tharanga & choose the one to pair up with Dickwella. Sheppslibra29 on May 26, 2017, 21:21 GMT Yeah these Australians started playing like they possessed ! If there is a trophy involved that's it . They are on the hunt my favorites this event . Next comes England and India . cricfan82865468 on May 26, 2017, 21:02 GMT Kula was weak today. If SL had Chamara or the youngster we cud hv been vert competitive. cricfan82865468 on May 26, 2017, 21:00 GMT Mathews did not use Malinga for 10 overs as theybwud monitor Mali's fitness to ball 10 overs. SL_Fan_5 on May 26, 2017, 21:00 GMT I agree with a few folks here. With Tharanga and Mendis we are a 280 batting side. With KJP in for one of them we are a 310 plus side. Late order is now strong enough to hold us from a total collapse and there are plenty of batsmen to accumulate. On a good day, if KJP and Dickwella click, we can surprise any of the teams we play in the first round. Kule and Prasad needs to be rotated properly based on the pitch. Alan Donald and Ford needs to figure that out. Our bowling is weak, so fielding needs to step up to close the gap... but definitely positive signs. cricfan82865468 on May 26, 2017, 20:59 GMT Any team can win this tournament fot sure. six-hitter on May 26, 2017, 20:50 GMT The Cow Corner, Australia had their 2 best players out and still won, yet you say they can't win and SL look good? Save your Australia bashing for after the tournament. Bengali-Tiger007 on May 26, 2017, 20:04 GMT I don't see anything wrong here, good practice match played by both teams. This is what warm ups are for, its not about winning or losing, its all about getting all 22 players out there in the middle. Can't seem to understand why some fans taking it to the swords! Good luck SL in the tournament from a BD fan! cricfan9033227104 on May 26, 2017, 19:44 GMT A great game of cricket but it's just a warm uo..that's why mathews didn't give malinga to bowl his last two overs.Anyway sri lankan bowling shoul be more economical trinikanyewest on May 26, 2017, 19:32 GMT Second game in a row slk bowlers has been put to the sword and they failed. Malaka on May 26, 2017, 19:02 GMT Good to see Mathews saving Mali for official games (8 overs only and not giving death overs)... I think KJP and Suranga should replace Kule and K Mendis.. KJP matured so much as a batsman. hope he will get chance @ no 3 in next practice match vs NZ.. good luck lions.. Cricinfouser on May 26, 2017, 19:01 GMT Kulusakera is a weak link. Not a bad performance overall . Bowling needs improving. Deepfreezed on May 26, 2017, 18:52 GMT If I were the AUS, I would be worried after this performance. SL by no means one of the contenders and AUS took it till the last over. Typical show by SL. Collapse, rescue act by the usual players, leak runs bowling. Only one legged Malinga looked decent when bowling. Dickwella should watch out with the ramp shot. Now they have fielders specially for that which means there is a gap in the off or on that he can go for. TheCowCorner on May 26, 2017, 18:52 GMT Also shows how weak Aussie attack is without Starc. espn73481522 on May 26, 2017, 18:49 GMT It was an amazing encounter though it was just a warm up fixture....! However i think mathews mised the trick again when he dint call back his main stike bowler the slinger for 48th and 5oth overs who finished just 8 overs. I think it was the defferent bitween two team end of the day other wise it was a head to head very much evenly matched encounter.... any way best of luck LIONS for the rest of the series...! TheCowCorner on May 26, 2017, 18:48 GMT Very good from Sl, congrats on your great show. Aussie to be honest looks puny to win the title now. cricfan8540045390 on May 26, 2017, 18:46 GMT Don't read.

The project website is http://pybee.org/cricket . Cricket is a graphical tool that helps you run your test suites. Normal unittest test runners dump all output to the console, and provide very little detail while the suite is running. As a result: You can't start looking at failures until the test suite has completed running, It isn't a very accessible format for identifying patterns in test failures, It can be hard (or cumbersome) to re-run any tests that have failed. Why the name cricket ? Test Cricket is the most prestigious version of the game of cricket. Games last for up to 5 days... just like running some test suites. The usual approach for making cricket watchable is a generous dose of beer; in programming, Balmer Peak limits come into effect, so something else is required... Quickstart At present, Cricket has support for: Pre-Django 1.6 project test suites, Django 1.6+ project test suites using unittest2-style discovery, and unittest project test suites. In your Django project, install cricket, and then run it: $ pip install cricket $ cricket-django cricket-django will also work in Django's own tests directory -- i.e., you can use cricket-django to run Django's own test suite (for Django 1.6 or later). In a unittest project, install cricket, and then run it: $ pip install cricket $ cricket-unittest This will pop up a GUI window. Hit ""Run all"", and watch your test suite execute. A progress bar is displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the window, along with an estimate of time remaining. While the suite is running, you can click on test names to see the output of that test. If the test passed, it will be displayed in green; other test results will be shown in other colors. Problems under Ubuntu Ubuntu's packaging of Python omits the idlelib library from it's base package. If you're using Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 13.04, you can install idlelib by running: $ sudo apt-get install idle-python2.7 For other versions of Python and Ubuntu, you'll need to adjust this as appropriate. Problems under Windows If you're running Cricket in a virtualenv under Windows, you'll need to set an environment variable so that Cricket can find the TCL graphics library: $ set TCL_LIBRARY=c:\Python27\tcl\tcl8.5 You'll need to adjust the exact path to reflect your local Python install. You may find it helpful to put this line in the activate.bat script for your virtual environment so that it is automatically set whenever the virtualenv is activated.

Cricket Rules Search for: The rules of the greatest game of all Cricket Rules Cricket History Ground and Equipment Cricket Facts Techniques of Play Cricket Tournaments Cricket Rules Welcome to the greatest game of all – Cricket. This site will help explain to an absolute beginner some of the basic rules of cricket. Although there are many more rules in cricket than in many other sports, it is well worth your time learning them as it is a most rewarding sport. Whether you are looking to play in the backyard with a mate or join a club Cricket-Rules will help you learn the basics and begin to enjoy one of the most popular sports in the world. The game is ever popular, with many fans attending to watch their local and national teams, the craze is always growing. With a number of big tournaments like The Ashes, IPL League and the granddaddy of them all, the ICC World Cup Cricket 2019 ! The game of cricket is highly popular, and the number of cricket betting fans who place bets on their national and local teams is also growing. Cricket is a game played with a bat and ball on a large field, known as a ground, between two teams of 11 players each. The object of the game is to score runs when at bat and to put out, or dismiss, the opposing batsmen when in the field. The cricket rules displayed on this page here are for the traditional form of cricket which is called “Test Cricket”. However there are other formats of the game eg. 50 over matches, Twenty20 Cricket etc where the rules differ slightly. Fielding positions in cricket for a right-handed batsman A typical cricket field Player: Official Cricket Rules Cricket is a game played between two teams made up of eleven players each. There is also a reserve player called a “twelfth man” who is used should a player be injured during play. The twelfth man is not allowed to bowl, bat, wicket keep or captain the team. His sole duty is to act as a substitute fielder. The original player is free to return to the game as soon as they have recovered from their injury. To apply the law and make sure the cricket rules are upheld throughout the game there are two umpires in place during games. Umpires are responsible for making decisions and notifying the scorers of these decisions. Two umpires are in place on the playing field while there is also a third umpire off the field who is in charge of video decisions. This is where the call is too close for the on field umpires and they refer it to the third umpire who reviews slow motion video replays to make a decision. Game Structure Test cricket is a game that spans over two innings. This means that one team needs to bowl the other team out twice and score more runs then them to win the match. Another key difference between test cricket and other forms of cricket is the length of the innings. In test cricket there is no limit to the innings length. Whereas in one day cricket & Twenty20 cricket there are a certain amount of overs per innings. The only limits in test cricket is a 5 day length. Before the game begins an official will toss a coin. The captain who guesses the correct side of the coin will then choose if they want to bat or field first. One team will then bat while the other will bowl & field. The aim of the batting team is to score runs while the aim of the fielding team is to bowl ten people out and close the batting teams’ innings. Although there are eleven people in each team only ten people need to be bowled out as you cannot have one person batting alone. Batting is done in pairs. Once the first team has been bowled out the second team would then go into bat. Once the second team is then bowled out it would normally return to the first team batting again. However there is an exception to this in the cricket rules, it is called the follow-on. The follow-on is when the first team makes at least 200 runs more than the second team made (in a 5 day test match). This then gives the first team the option to make the second team bat again. This is particularly useful if the game is progressing slowly or affected by bad weather and there might not be enough time for both teams to play a full innings. Should this be the case the batting team’s captain also has the right to forfeit their innings at any time. This is called a declaration. Some may wonder why a captain would forfeit the opportunity for his team to bat. However if the game is coming close to a close and it looks like they will not be able to bowl the other team out again this could be an option. If one team is not bowled out twice and a winner determined in the five days of play the game is declared a draw. Therefore it may be worth declaring an innings to creat the possibility of a win rather than a draw. Ways to score runs The aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main cricket rules is that for batsmen to score runs they must run to each other’s end of the pitch (from one end to the other). In doing this one run is scored. Cricket rules state they may run multiple runs per shot. As well as running they can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A boundary scores the batsmen either 4 or 6 runs. A four is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary after hitting the ground while a six is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary on the full (before it hits the ground). Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 has been scored any runs physically ran by the batsman are null & void. They will only obtain the 4 or 6 runs. Other ways runs can be scored according to the cricket rules include no balls, wide balls, byes & leg byes. Cricket rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded to the batting team but not the individual batters. A “ No Ball ” can be declared for many reasons: If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when bowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The batsman can hit a no ball and score runs off it but cannot be out from a no ball except if they are ran out, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the field. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no ball for his shot while the team also gains one run for the no ball itself. A “ Wide Ball ” will be declared if the umpire thinks the batsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to score off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide but a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide deliveries in the shorter format of the game while being much more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will add one run to the batting team and any runs scored by the batsman. The batsman is not able to get out off a wide delivery except if they are stumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or obstruct the field. A “ Bye ” is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes the striking batsman and runs are scored without the batsman hitting the ball. A “ Leg Bye ” is where runs are scored by hitting the batsman, but not the bat and the ball is not a no ball or wide. However no runs can be scored if the striking batsman didn’t attempt to play a shot or if he was avoiding the ball. Ways Batsmen can be given out according to cricket rules There are a number of different ways a batsman can be given out in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman out it is said that the bowler gets a “wicket”. Following are the different ways a batsman can be given out according to the rules of cricket: Bowled – Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled and hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is given out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the ball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched the batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of the batsman. However the ball is not allowed to have touched another player or umpire before hitting the wickets. Caught – Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits the ball or touches the ball at all with his bat or hand/glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. This is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this is done then cricket rules state the batsman is out. Leg Before Wicket (LBW) – If the ball is bowled and it hits the batsman first without the bat hitting it then an LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to give this out he must first look at some of the factors stated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire need to decide is would the ball have hit the wickets if the batsman was not there. If his answer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on the leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman out. However if the ball hits the batsman outside the line of off stump while he was attempting to play a stroke then he is not out. Stumped – A batsman can be given out according to cricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his wicket while he is out of his crease and not attempting a run (if he is attempting a run it would be a runout). Run Out – Cricket rules state that a batsman is out if no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly put down by the fielding side. Hit Wicket – Cricket rules specify that if a batsman hits his wicket down with his bat or body after the bowler has entered his delivery stried and the ball is in play then he is out. The striking batsman is also out if he hits his wicket down while setting off for his first run. Handled The Ball – Cricket rules allow the batsman to be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the hand that is not touching the bat without the consent of the opposition. Timed Out – An incoming batsman must be ready to face a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner within three minutes of the outgoing batsman being dismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman can be given out. Hit The Ball Twice – Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose of protecting his wicket or with consent from the opposition he is out. Obstructing The Field – A batsman is out if he willingly obstructs the opposition by word or action There are many other cricket rules.

48," Cricket pay dispute could require government intervention, Sport Minister Greg Hunt says - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) ABC Home Open Sites menu ABC Home News iview TV Radio Kids Shop More Search Australia Weather News Home Just In Australia World Trump's America Business Sport Science Arts Analysis Programs More Special coverage Full coverage of news and events surrounding Reconciliation Week 2017 Email Cricket pay dispute could require government intervention, Sport Minister Greg Hunt says Posted May 28, 2017 11:29:31 Photo: Australian cricket's pay dispute could result in government intervention. (AP: Aijaz Rahi) Map: Australia The Government would likely step in should the pay stand-off between Cricket Australia and the players reach a crisis point,"" federal sport minister Greg Hunt says. With only weeks of the memorandum of understanding remaining and the prospect of a player strike still lurking in the background, the situation appears no closer to being resolved. Australia's players could find themselves out of contract and without pay from July 1, and some have raised the prospect of an Ashes boycott if the situation can not be remedied. External Link: Insiders ABC tweet: ?@GregHuntMP:If it got to a last-minute situation I suspect we would offer to work with Cricket Australia and the players. #Insiders #auspol But Mr Hunt says the summer of cricket is ""part of our national identity"", and the Government would ensure no such boycott would occur. ""If it got to a last-minute situation, I suspect that we would offer to provide good offices brokering between the parties,"" Mr Hunt said on Insiders. ""But there is six months between now and the Ashes. It would be unthinkable that in the end, we wouldn't have a full team. ""I do not see either the players or the administration returning to the late '70s where we had a second-rate team. The players love playing for Australia. ""The administration, Cricket Australia, knows that this is not just fundamental to sport, it is part of our national identity. I am very confident that they will reach an agreement."" Government intervention could set a dangerous precedent, especially considering how frequent sporting pay disputes have been in Australia in recent months. But Mr Hunt said he would only step in at an appropriate time, and if the relevant cricket bodies were receptive to the intervention. ""What I don't want to do, across all sports, is try to step in and become the mediator in contract disputes,"" he said. ""If there were a fundamental threat, at an appropriate time, we would offer to work with them. ""But all the advice I have is that we're six months to travel and the Ashes will be proceeding with a full Australian team and come Boxing Day, you'll have Steve Smith and David Warner and the rest of the team out there.""
