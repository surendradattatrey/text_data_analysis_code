The need for action is clear. CEOs and board members must manage cybersecurity risks through proactive engagement. sponsored Is edge analytics the front line of cybersecurity? Email a friend To Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. The sooner an enterprise can shut down a security problem, the better. But that depends on the availability of actionable, up-to-date information to inform the security team as they essentially race against the clock to stop the bad guys. That has hastened a rethink of how to more effectively sift through the massive streams of information generated nowadays to make better, and faster , decisions. One idea gaining currency is to shift the front lines of cybersecurity closer to where data is actually generated by sensors, controllers and other network devices. Shifting to the e dge The con c ept extends the idea of edge computing to data gathering and analysis. Instead of analyzing information generated by sensors at a central computing station, d ata would be sent through sensors and devices where security is already built in . The advantage is that analytics would get performed closer to the devices that actually generated the data. In theory, that allows IT to more quickly understand what’s happening with their organization’s assets and better gauge evolving threats to carry out predictive maintenance or detect security anomalies in real ti me. The emergence of B ig D ata as well as the spread of the Internet of Things creates myriad scenarios where the deployment of analytics algorithms on the edge can reduce response times and hel p security managers swarm more rapidly in case of breaches or malfunctions. Indeed, edge analytics has been described as a veritable antidot e to the coming data deluge . Take the example of a n industrial network where there might be thousands of small sensors placed throughout a production line. Manufacturing organizations that move analytics to the edge of their networks can me asure and correlate information generated by those sensors in real time and alert managers to potential security or failure conditions before they spread out of control. Edge a nalytics en r oute Organizations also reap scalability benefits by ligh tening the load on existing enterprise data management and analytics systems. This can be especially important in situations where there’s no time to waste waiting for sensor systems to transmit data to a remote cloud. Take the question of train safety. G eneral Electric’s Transportation’s Evolution Series Tier 4 Locomotive is one of the company’s most modern trains . Each locomotive , which features more than 200 sensors processing over one billion instructions per second, makes use of on-board edge computing to analyze data and apply algorithms to run more safely. With trains generating more data than ever, organizations need to choose what data matters most to improve performance and avoid failures. In the case of the Tier 4, the faster reaction time at the network edge can make a big difference by ensuring that what is really relevant is what gets transferred . Edge analytics is obviously not going to appeal to every organization. But companies that are able to effect the change and p ut automated, intelligent analytics at the edge will have a powerful tool to deploy against malicious hackers in the years ahead.

According to Wikipedia, analytics is ""the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data."" Seems obvious, right? Where the real story with analytics lies, however, is in what you can do with it. Think in terms of possibilities. Opportunities. Discoveries. Made possible by technological advancements in analytics that were never even dreamed of not so very long ago, within your lifetime. So let's explore the topic of analytics together. We'll share insights from the brightest minds in analytics – insights that you can turn into ... well, it's up to you. Learn about analytics Big Data Analytics As data floods your organization on a daily basis, the question is no longer ""What is big data?"" Instead, it's ""What can we do with the big data we have?"" The answer, of course, is integral to the future of your business. And big data analytics opens up the world of the possible. With big data analytics, you can implement data mining, predictive analytics, text mining, forecasting and optimization to explore your options and make the best possible business decisions. Learn more about big data analytics Data Mining Have you heard the one about the retailer that discovered diapers and beer are often purchased together? What about the telco that can predict your likelihood to switch carriers based on how many of your friends have already switched? These businesses used data mining to uncover completely unexpected insights in their data. What secrets are hiding in your ever-growing data stores? Find out with data mining. Read more about data mining Deep Learning If you've ever held a conversation with Siri, you've used deep learning. Systems such as Siri, Alexa and Cortana are driven in part by deep learning, a type of machine learning that trains a computer to complete human-like tasks. Speech recognition, image recognition and natural language processing are all powered by deep learning, which trains a computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns. How can you use it? And how will it affect your industry? Learn more about deep learning Machine Learning Machine learning isn’t new. But now it's high-powered. And that’s giving this decades-old mathematical science new momentum in the world of big data. Self-driving vehicles? That's machine learning in action. Email spam filters and online shopping recommendations? That's machine learning for everyday life. Fraud detection? One of the more obvious – and important – uses in our world today. Discover how machine learning can help you find answers to complex problems. Read more about machine learning Predictive Analytics So you’ve embraced the power of collecting and analyzing data. That’s a great first step, but it just scratches the surface. To get the most out of your data, you need to anticipate the future, not just analyze the past. Whether you want to attract new customers, assess payment risk, identify fraud or forecast energy demand, predictive analytics can provide answers to your most complex questions. Learn more about predictive analytics Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis isn’t just for sports geeks and political pollsters. Every day, statistics plays a critical role in informing public policy and improving human welfare. The field of statistics has grown from sampling populations to analyzing even the biggest of big data sources. Today’s statisticians are tracking endangered species, improving agricultural processes and predicting the best treatments for complex diseases. There's a lot going on with this influential field and the statistical programming techniques used by today’s statisticians.

Video Changing the customer conversation with predictive data analysis Big datais enjoying major popularity at the moment, with algorithms and machine learning at the core of almost every business application. This cutting edge technology utilises massive datasets to run increasingly complex algorithmsto make decisions with far reaching consequences. Big data culture is becoming the norm as companies strive to acquire the business intelligence that comes as a result of predictive models and statistical analyses. There is great value in this as it allows companies to draw conclusions and use prescriptive statistics to make intelligent business decisions. But at what point does the data start controlling the business user instead of the business user controlling the data? People seem to accept the power of big data at face value because if it was spewed out of a machine, it must be right. Right? Wrong! There are inherent errors and weaknesses in most analytical models, as proven by Kurt Gödel with his incompleteness theorems , which predict that every formal system eventually fails. And unfortunately with big data, the scope of failure is correspondingly larger. Here are the three most common underlying causes for issues with big data. Phantom data Most numbers we deal with in daily decision making, come from massive databases and have been analysed through complex analytical processes before we eventually see them. At first glance there is no way to tell if these numbers are accurate. In most cases, the original numbers are punched into a machine on the manufacturing shop floor by front-line employees. Thus, the input data is subject to human error. At the front end, cashiers are still responsible for ringing up the correct bar codes, and stock personnel are still responsible for counting and placing stock correctly. We haven’t outsourced these necessities to machines yet and consequently, errors in this stage of the process can result in larger discrepancies further up the line and result in inappropriate purchasing and marketing decisions. Thus, it is critical to control the numbers going into any system. The GIGO (garbage in = garbage out) theory holds true in this respect, and thus control points and cross referencing is crucial to any manufacturing or business process to negate human error and ensure the data being fed into the algorithms is accurate. For example, a study reveals that up to 65 percent of retailers inventory is inaccurate. Phantom stock causes problems in the retail arena, as the control system says the stock is there but for whatever reason (theft, fraud or miscounting) the items are not available when customers request them. This leads to customer dissatisfaction and possible legal problems higher up, as procurement is also impacted. Blindly believing the numbers Data has become so entrenched in our lives and we rely on it almost exclusively for certain functions. A particularly common algorithm is the one governing job performance evaluation. The job rating is used by superiors to assess performance, but what they don’t assess is the entire paradigm. They don’t take into consideration extenuating circumstances, like perhaps an outlier in the data set has skewed the results. Unfortunately, the powers that be take the end result regardless for evaluation purposes. If it was a person’s judgement, people wouldn’t hesitate to question, but the results of data analytics often go unchallenged. The school system in America has been privy to this type of data misrepresentation. Declining SAT scores sent the school system reeling and making dramatic changes to rectify the situation. On closer analysis, the scores were actually subject to Simpson’s paradox. This is a statistical error that occurs when the mean declines as a result of increased number of lower scores in the dataset. In this instance, the causal factor was the growth in number of disadvantaged children taking the test. It is essential to consider if your data set has changed in any way before direct comparisons can be made. A prime example is the increase in the incident rate on the factory floor, whereas it was actually just an increase in reporting of the incidents that skewed the results. Statistical over-fitting In many businesses, decisions are made based on statistical inferences drawn from past behaviours. This system is inherently flawed, especially where the data set is small enough for a few outliers to skew the outcome considerably. There is an element of randomness in every data set, which assumes that the more precisely a predictive model is tailored to past events; the less likely it is to accurately reflect the future. Don’t fall prey to the numbers game Even the most complicated and high end models fail some times. And when they do, it’s usually catastrophic. For example with stock market prediction models, there are millions of dollars at stake. As we increasingly rely on machines for the information we use to make decisions, we should do so with open minds. Ask questions and find out how the figures are calculated and what assumptions are used in the models. To blindly accept numbers is foolhardy. It is imperative to know how the data was collected and how the inferences were drawn, that way informed decisions can be made. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

The clause is a prefix to a query, and the scope of the binding is that query. (Let doesn't provide a way to name things that you use later in your session.) Syntax let name = scalar_constant_expression ; query let name = query ; query let name = (parameterName : type [, ...]) { plain_query }; query let name = (parameterName : type [, ...]) { scalar_expression }; query type: bool , int , long , double , string , timespan , datetime , guid , dynamic plain_query: A query not prefixed by a let-clause. Examples let rows = (n:long) { range steps from 1 to n step 1 }; rows(10) | ... Convert a table result to a scalar and use in a query: let topCities = toscalar ( // convert single column to value requests | summarize count() by client_City | top 4 by count_ | summarize makeset(client_City)) ; requests | where client_City in (topCities) | summarize count() by client_City; materialize Use materialize() to improve the performance where the result of a let clause is used more than once downstream. Materialize() evaluates and caches the result of a tabular let clause at the time of query execution, ensuring that the query isn't executed more than once. Syntax materialize(expression) Arguments expresion : Tabular expression to be evaluated and cached during query execution. Tips Use materialize when you have join/union where their operands has mutual sub-queries that can be executed once (see the examples below). Useful also in scenarios when we need to join/union fork legs. Materialize is allowed to be used only in let statements by giving the cached result a name. Materialze has a cache size limit which is 5 GB. This limit is per cluster node and is mutual for all the queries. Example: self-join let totalPagesPerDay = pageViews | summarize by name, Day = startofday(timestamp) | summarize count() by Day; let materializedScope = pageViews | summarize by name, Day = startofday(timestamp); let cachedResult = materialize(materializedScope); cachedResult | project name, Day1 = Day | join kind = inner ( cachedResult | project name, Day2 = Day ) on name | where Day2 > Day1 | summarize count() by Day1, Day2 | join kind = inner totalPagesPerDay on $left.Day1 == $right.Day | project Day1, Day2, Percentage = count_*100.0/count_1 The uncached version uses the result scope twice: let totalPagesPerDay = pageViews | summarize by name, Day = startofday(timestamp) | summarize count() by Day; let scope = pageViews | summarize by name, Day = startofday(timestamp); scope // First use of this table. | project name, Day1 = Day | join kind = inner ( scope // Second use can cause evaluation twice. | project name, Day2 = Day ) on name | where Day2 > Day1 | summarize count() by Day1, Day2 | join kind = inner totalPagesPerDay on $left.Day1 == $right.Day | project Day1, Day2, Percentage = count_*100.0/count_1 Queries and operators A query over your telemetry is made up of a reference to a source stream, followed by a pipeline of filters. For example: requests // The request table starts this pipeline. | where client_City == ""London"" // filter the records and timestamp > ago(3d) | count Each filter prefixed by the pipe character | is an instance of an operator , with some parameters. The input to the operator is the table that is the result of the preceding pipeline. In most cases, any parameters are scalar expressions over the columns of the input. In a few cases, the parameters are the names of input columns, and in a few cases, the parameter is a second table. The result of a query is always a table, even if it only has one column and one row. Queries may contain single line breaks, but are terminated by a blank line. They may contain comments between // and end of line. A query may be prefixed by one or more let clauses , which define scalars, tables, or functions that can be used within the query. let interval = 3d ; let city = ""London"" ; let req = (city:string) { requests | where client_City == city and timestamp > ago(interval) }; req(city) | count T is used in query examples below to denote the preceding pipeline or source table. as operator Temporarily binds a name to the input tabular expression. Syntax T | as name Arguments name: A temporary name for the table Notes Use let instead of as if you want to use the name in a later subexpression. Use as to specify the name of the table as it appears in the result of a union , find , or search . Example range x from 1 to 10 step 1 | as T1 | union withsource=TableName (requests | take 10 | as T2) count operator The count operator returns the number of records (rows) in the input record set. Syntax T | count Arguments T : The tabular data whose records are to be counted. Returns This function returns a table with a single record and column of type long . The value of the only cell is the number of records in T . Example requests | count datatable operator Specify a table inline. The schema and values are defined in the query itself. Note that this operator does not have a pipeline input. Syntax datatable ( ColumnName1 : ColumnType1 , ...) [ScalarValue1, ...] ColumnName A name for a column. ColumnType A data type . ScalarValue A value of the appropriate type. The count of values must be a multiple of the number of columns. Returns A table containing the specified values. Example datatable (Date:datetime, Event:string) [datetime(1910-06-11), ""Born"", datetime(1930-01-01), ""Enters Ecole Navale"", datetime(1953-01-01), ""Published first book"", datetime(1997-06-25), ""Died""] | where strlen(Event) > 4 distinct operator Returns a table containing the set of rows that have distinct combinations of values. Optionally projects to a subset of the columns before the operation. Syntax T | distinct * // All columns T | distinct Column1, ... // Columns to project Example datatable (Supplier: string, Fruit: string, Price:int) [""Contoso"", ""Grapes"", 22, ""Fabrikam"", ""Apples"", 14, ""Contoso"", ""Apples"", 15, ""Fabrikam"", ""Grapes"", 22] | distinct Fruit, Price Fruit Price Grapes 22 Apples 14 Apples 15 evaluate operator evaluate is an extension mechanism that allows specialized algorithms to be appended to queries. evaluate must be the last operator in the query pipeline (except for a possible render ). It must not appear in a function body. evaluate autocluster | evaluate basket | evaluate diffpatterns | evaluate extractcolumns evaluate autocluster T | evaluate autocluster() Autocluster is a quick way to find the natural groupings in a set of data. For example, from a mass of request data, you might quickly identify that 80% of the 404 failures were requests for one particular URL, made by a client in a particular city. AutoCluster finds common patterns of discrete attributes (dimensions) in the data and will reduce the results of the original query (whether it's 100 or 100k rows) to a small number of patterns. AutoCluster was developed to help analyze failures (e.g. exceptions, crashes) but can potentially work on any filtered data set. Syntax T | evaluate autocluster( arguments ) Returns AutoCluster returns a (usually small) set of patterns that capture portions of the data with shared common values across multiple discrete attributes. Each pattern is represented by a row in the results. The first two columns are the count and percentage of rows out of the original query that are captured by the pattern. The remaining columns are from the original query and their value is either a specific value from the column or '*' meaning variable values. Note that the patterns are not disjoint: they may be overlapping, and usually do not cover all the original rows. Some rows may not fall under any pattern. Tips Use where and project in the input pipe to reduce the data to just what you're interested in. When you find an interesting row, you might want to drill into it further by adding its specific values to your where filter. Arguments (all optional) output=all | values | minimal The format of the results. The Count and Percent columns always appear in the results. all - all the columns from the input are output values - filters out columns with only '*' in the results minimal - also filters out columns that are identical for all the rows in the original query. min_percent= double (default: 1) The minimum percentage coverage of the generated rows. Example: T | evaluate autocluster(""min_percent=5.5"") num_seeds= int (default: 25) The number of seeds determines the number of initial local search points of the algorithm. In some cases, depending on the structure of the data, increasing the number of seeds increases the number (or quality) of the results through increased search space at slower query tradeoff. The num_seeds argument has diminishing results in both directions so decreasing it below 5 will achieve negligible performance improvements and increasing above 50 will rarely generate additional patterns. Example: T | evaluate autocluster(""num_seeds=50"") size_weight= 0<double<1 + (default: 0.5) Gives you some control over the balance between generic (high coverage) and informative (many shared values). Increasing size_weight usually reduces the number of patterns, and each pattern tends to cover a larger percentage. Decreasing size_weight usually produces more specific patterns with more shared values and smaller percentage coverage. The under the hood formula is a weighted geometric mean between the normalized generic score and informative score with size_weight and 1-size_weight as the weights. Example: T | evaluate autocluster(""size_weight=0.8"") weight_column= column_name Considers each row in the input according to the specified weight (by default each row has a weight of '1'), common usage of a weight column is to take into account sampling or bucketing/aggregation of the data that is already embedded into each row. Example: T | evaluate autocluster(""weight_column=sample_Count"") evaluate basket (deprecated) T | evaluate basket() This version of basket is deprecated. Please use basket_v2 . Returns All patterns appearing in more than a specified fraction (default 0.05) of the events. Arguments (all optional) threshold= 0.015<double<1 (default: 0.05) Sets the minimal ratio of the rows to be considered frequent (patterns with smaller ratio will not be returned). Example: T | evaluate basket(""threshold=0.02"") weight_column= column_name Considers each row in the input according to the specified weight (by default each row has a weight of '1'), common usage of a weight column is to take into account sampling or bucketing/aggregation of the data that is already embedded into each row. Example: T | evaluate basket(""weight_column=sample_Count"") max_dims= 1<int (default: 5) Sets the maximal number of uncorrelated dimensions per basket, limited by default to decrease the query runtime. output=minimize | all The format of the results. The Count and Percent columns always appear in the results. minimize - filters out columns with only '*' in the results. all - all the columns from the input are output. evaluate basket_v2 T | evaluate basket_v2() Basket finds all frequent patterns of discrete attributes (dimensions) in the data and will return all frequent patterns that passed the frequency threshold in the original query. Basket is guaranteed to find all frequent patterns in the data but is not guaranteed to have polynomial run-time. The run-time of the query is linear in the number of rows but in some cases might be exponential in the number of columns (dimensions). Basket is based on the Apriori algorithm originally developed for basket analysis data mining. Replaces the deprecated evaluate basket syntax. Returns All patterns appearing in more than a specified fraction (default 0.05) of the events. For each pattern, columns that are not set in the pattern (i.e. without restricition on a specific value) will contain a wildcard value which are by default null values (see in the Arguments section below how they can be manually changed). Arguments (all optional) All arguments are optional, but must be in the following order. To indicate that a default value should be used, use the tilde character '~' (see examples below). Threshold: 0.015 < double < 1 (default: 0.05) Sets the minimal ratio of the rows to be considered frequent (patterns with smaller ratio will not be returned). Example: T | evaluate basket(0.02) Weight column itemCount Use this to take into account sampling and metric pre-aggregation. Each row is attributed the weight specified in this column. By default each row has a weight of '1'. This takes into account the bucketing or aggregation of the data that is already embedded into each row. Example: T | evaluate basket('~', itemCount) Max dimensions: 1 < int (default: 5) Sets the maximal number of uncorrelated dimensions per basket, limited by default to decrease the query runtime. Example: T | evaluate basket('~', '~', 3) Custom wildcard types: any value per type Sets the wildcard value for a specific type in the result table that will indicate that the current pattern doesn't have a restriction on this column. Default is null, for string default is an empty string. If the default is a viable value in the data, a different wildcard value should be used (e.g. *). Example: T | evaluate basket_v2('~', '~', '~', '*', int(-1), double(-1), long(0), datetime(1900-1-1)) Example requests | evaluate basket_v2(0.7, itemCount) evaluate diffpatterns requests | evaluate diffpatterns(""split=success"") Diffpatterns identifies the differences between two datasets of the same structure - for example, the request log at the time of an incident, and normal request logs. Diffpatterns was developed to help analyze failures (e.g. by comparing failures to non-failures in a given time frame) but can potentially find differences between any two data sets of the same structure. Syntax T | evaluate diffpatterns(""split= BinaryColumn "" [, arguments] ) Returns Diffpatterns returns a (usually small) set of patterns that capture different portions of the data in the two sets (i.e. a pattern capturing a large percentage of the rows in the first data set and low percentage of the rows in the second set). Each pattern is represented by a row in the results. The first four columns are the count and percentage of rows out of the original query that are captured by the pattern in each set, the fifth column is the difference (in absolute percentage points) between the two sets. The remaining columns are from the original query and their value is either a specific value from the column or * meaning variable values. Note that the patterns are not distinct: they may be overlapping, and usually do not cover all the original rows. Some rows may not fall under any pattern. Tips Use where and project in the input pipe to reduce the data to just what you're interested in. When you find an interesting row, you might want to drill into it further by adding its specific values to your where filter. Arguments split= column name (required) The column must have precisely two values. If necessary, create such a column: requests | extend fault = toint(resultCode) >= 500 | evaluate diffpatterns(""split=fault"") target= string Tells the algorithm to only look for patterns which have higher percentage in the target data set, the target must be one of the two values of the split column. requests | evaluate diffpatterns(""split=success"", ""target=false"") threshold= 0.015<double<1 (default: 0.05) Sets the minimal pattern (ratio) difference between the two sets. requests | evaluate diffpatterns(""split=success"", ""threshold=0.04"") output=minimize | all The format of the results. The Count and Percent columns always appear in the results. minimize - filters out columns with only '*' in the results all - all the columns from the input are output weight_column= column_name Considers each row in the input according to the specified weight (by default each row has a weight of '1'). A common use of a weight column is to take into account sampling or bucketing/aggregation of the data that is already embedded into each row. requests | evaluate autocluster(""weight_column=itemCount"") evaluate extractcolumns exceptions | take 1000 | evaluate extractcolumns(""details=json"") Extractcolumns is used to enrich a table with multiple simple columns that are dynamically extracted out of (semi) structured column(s) based on their type. Currently it supports json columns only, both dynamic and string serialization of jsons. max_columns= int (default: 10) The number of new added columns is dynamic and it can be very big (actually it’s the number of distinct keys in all json records) so we must limit it. The new columns are sorted in descending order based on their frequency and up to max_columns are added to the table. T | evaluate extractcolumns(""json_column_name=json"", ""max_columns=30"") min_percent= double (default: 10.0) Another way to limit new columns by ignoring columns whose frequency is lower than min_percent. T | evaluate extractcolumns(""json_column_name=json"", ""min_percent=60"") add_prefix= bool (default: true) If true the name of the complex column will be added as a prefix to the extracted columns names. prefix_delimiter= string (default: ""_"") If add_prefix=true this parameter defines the delimiter that will be used to concatenate the names of the new columns. T | evaluate extractcolumns(""json_column_name=json"", ""add_prefix=true"", ""prefix_delimiter=@"") keep_original= bool (default: false) If true the original (json) columns will be kept in the output table. output=query | table The format of the results. table - The output is the same table as received minus the specified input columns plus new columns that were extracted from the input columns. query - The output is a string representing the query you would make to get the result as table. extend operator T | extend duration = stopTime - startTime Append one or more calculated columns to a table. Syntax T | extend ColumnName = Expression [, ...] Arguments T: The input table. ColumnName: The name of a columns to add. Names are case-sensitive and can contain alphabetic, numeric or '_' characters. Use ['...'] or [""...""] to quote keywords or names with other characters. Expression: A calculation over the existing columns. Returns A copy of the input table, with the specified additional columns. Tips Use project instead, if you also want to drop or rename some columns. Don't use extend simply to get a shorter name to use in a long expression. ...| extend x = anonymous_user_id_from_client | ... func(x) ... The native columns of the table have been indexed; your new name defines an additional column that isn't indexed, so the query is likely to run slower. Example traces | extend Age = now() - timestamp find operator find in (Table1, Table2, Table3) where id==""a string"" find in (Table1, Table2, Table3) where id==""a string"" project column1, column2 find in (Table1, Table2, Table3) where * has ""a string"" find in (Table1, Table2, Table3) where appName in (""string 1"", ""string 2"", ""string 3"") Find rows that match a predicate across a set of tables. Syntax find in (Table1, ...) where Predicate [project Column1, ...] Arguments Table1 A table name or query. It can be a let-defined table, but not a function. A table name performs better than a query. Predicate A boolean expression evaluated for every row in the specified tables. You can use ""*"" in place of a column name in string comparisons Column1 The project option allows you to specify which columns must always appear in the output. Result By default, the output table contains: source_ - An indicator of the source table for each row. Use as at the end of each table expression, if you want to specify the name that appears in this column. Columns explicitly mentioned in the predicate Non-empty columns common to all the input tables. pack_ - A property bag containing the data from the other columns. Notice that this format can change with changes in the input data or predicate. To specify a fixed set of columns, use project . Example Get all the requests and exceptions, excluding those from availability tests and robots: find in (requests, exceptions) where isempty(operation_SyntheticSource) Find all requests and exceptions from UK, excluding those from availability tests and robots: let requk = requests | where client_CountryOrRegion == ""United Kingdom""; let exuk = exceptions | where client_CountryOrRegion == ""United Kingdom""; find in (requk, exuk) where isempty(operation_SyntheticSource) Find most recent telemetry where any field contains the term 'test': find in (traces, requests, pageViews, dependencies, customEvents, availabilityResults, exceptions) where * has 'test' | top 100 by timestamp desc Performance Tips Add time-based terms to the where predicate. Use let clauses rather than writing queries inline. getschema operator T | getschema Yields a table that shows the column names and types of the input table. requests | project appId, appName, customDimensions, duration, iKey, itemCount, success, timestamp | getschema join operator Table1 | join (Table2) on CommonColumn Merges the rows of two tables by matching values of the specified column. Syntax Table1 | join [kind=Kind] (Table2) on CommonColumn [, ...] Arguments Table1 - the 'left side' of the join. Table2 - the 'right side' of the join. It can be a nested query expression that outputs a table. CommonColumn - a column that has the same name in the two tables. Kind - specifies how rows from the two tables are to be matched. Returns A table with: A column for every column in each of the two tables, including the matching keys. The columns of the right side will be automatically renamed if there are name clashes. A row for every match between the input tables. A match is a row selected from one table that has the same value for all the on fields as a row in the other table. Kind unspecified or = innerunique Only one row from the left side is matched for each value of the on key. The output contains a row for each match of this row with rows from the right. kind=inner There's a row in the output for every combination of matching rows from left and right. kind=leftouter (or kind=rightouter or kind=fullouter ) In addition to the inner matches, there's a row for every row on the left (and/or right), even if it has no match. In that case, the unmatched output cells contain nulls. kind=leftanti Returns all the records from the left side that do not have matches from the right. The result table just has the columns from the left side. kind=leftsemi (or leftantisemi ) Returns a row from the left table if there is (or is not) a match for it in the right table. The result does not include data from the right. Tips There is a limit of 64MB on the result table. For best performance: Use where and project to reduce the numbers of rows and columns in the input tables, before the join . If one table is always smaller than the other, use it as the left (piped) side of the join. The columns for the join match must have the same name. Use the project operator if necessary to rename a column in one of the tables. Example Get extended activities from a log in which some entries mark the start and end of an activity. let Events = MyLogTable | where type==""Event"" ; Events | where Name == ""Start"" | project Name, City, ActivityId, StartTime=timestamp | join (Events | where Name == ""Stop"" | project StopTime=timestamp, ActivityId) on ActivityId | project City, ActivityId, StartTime, StopTime, Duration=StopTime-StartTime limit operator T | limit 5 Returns up to the specified number of rows from the input table. There is no guarantee which records are returned. (To return specific records, use top .) Alias take Syntax T | limit NumberOfRows Tips Take is a simple and efficient way to see a sample of your results when you're working interactively. Be aware that it doesn't guarantee to produce any particular rows, or to produce them in any particular order. There's an implicit limit on the number of rows returned to the client, even if you don't use take . To lift this limit, use the notruncation client request option. make-series operator Performs an aggregation. Unlike summarize , there is one output row for each group. In the result columns, the values in each group are packed into arrays. Syntax T | make-series [Column =] Aggregation default = DefaultValue [, ...] on AxisColumn in range(start, stop, step) by [Column =] GroupExpression [, ...] Arguments Column: Optional name for a result column. Defaults to a name derived from the expression. DefaultValue: If there is no row with specific values of AxisColumn and GroupExpression then in the results the correponding element of the array will be assigned with a DefaultValue. Aggregation: A numeric expression using an aggregation function . AxisColumn: A column on which the series is ordered. It can be considered as a timeline, but any numeric types are accepted. start, stop, step: Defines the list of values of AxisColumn for every row. Every other result aggregation column has an array of the same length. GroupExpression: An expression over the columns, that provides a set of distinct values. There is one row in the output for each value of the GroupExpression. Typically it's a column name that already provides a restricted set of values. Tip The result arrays are rendered in an Analytics chart in the same way as the corresponding summarize operation. Example requests | make-series sum(itemCount) default=0, avg(duration) default=0 on timestamp in range (ago(7d), now(), 1d) by client_City mvexpand operator T | mvexpand listColumn Expands an list from a dynamic-typed (JSON) cell so that each entry has a separate row. All the other cells in an expanded row are duplicated. (See also summarize makelist which performs the opposite function.) Example Assume the input table is: A:int B:string D:dynamic 1 ""hello"" {""key"":""value""} 2 ""world"" [0,1,""k"",""v""] mvexpand D Result is: A:int B:string D:dynamic 1 ""hello"" {""key"":""value""} 2 ""world"" 0 2 ""world"" 1 2 ""world"" ""k"" 2 ""world"" ""v"" Syntax T | mvexpand [bagexpansion=(bag | array)] ColumnName [limit Rowlimit] T | mvexpand [bagexpansion=(bag | array)] [Name =] ArrayExpression [to typeof(Typename)] [limit Rowlimit] Arguments ColumnName: In the result, arrays in the named column are expanded to multiple rows. ArrayExpression: An expression yielding an array. If this form is used, a new column is added and the existing one is preserved. Name: A name for the new column. Typename: Casts the expanded expression to a particular type RowLimit: The maximum number of rows generated from each original row. The default is 128. Returns Multiple rows for each of the values in any array in the named column or in the array expression. The expanded column always has dynamic type. Use a cast such as todatetime() or toint() if you want to compute or aggregate values. Two modes of property-bag expansions are supported: bagexpansion=bag : Property bags are expanded into single-entry property bags. This is the default expansion. bagexpansion=array : Property bags are expanded into two-element [ key , value ] array structures, allowing uniform access to keys and values (as well as, for example, running a distinct-count aggregation over property names). Examples exceptions | take 1 | mvexpand details[0] Splits an exception record into rows for each item in the details field. parse operator T | parse ""I got 2 socks for my birthday when I was 63 years old"" with * ""got"" counter:long "" "" present ""for"" * ""was"" year:long * T | parse kind=relaxed ""I got no socks for my birthday when I was 63 years old"" with * ""got"" counter:long "" "" present ""for"" * ""was"" year:long * T | parse kind=regex ""I got socks for my 63rd birthday"" with ""(I|She) got "" present "" for .*?"" year:long * Extracts values from a string. Can use simple or regular expression matching. Syntax T | parse [kind=regex|relaxed] SourceText with [Match | Column [: Type [*]] ] ... Arguments T : The input table. kind : simple (default): the Match strings are plain strings. relaxed : if the text doesn't parse as the type of a column, the column is set to null and the parse continues regex : the Match strings are regular expressions. Text : A column or other expression that evaluates to or can be converted to a string. Match: Match the next part of the string, and discard it. Column: Assign the next part of the string to this column. The column is created if it does not exist. Type: Parse the next part of the string as the specified type, such as int, date, double. Returns The input table, extended according to the list of Columns. The elements in the with clause are matched against the source text in turn. Each element chews off a chunk of the source text: A literal string or regular expression moves the matching cursor by the length of the match. In a regex parse, a regular expression can use the minimization operator '?' to move as soon as possible to the following match. A column name with a type parses the text as the specified type. Unless kind=relaxed, an unsuccessful parse invalidates matching the whole pattern. A column name without a type, or with the type 'string', copies the minimum number of characters to get to the following match. ' * ' Skips the minimum number of characters to get to the following match. You can use '*' at the start and end of the pattern, or after a type other than string, or between string matches. All of the elements in a parse pattern must match correctly; otherwise, no results will be produced. The exception to this rule is that when kind=relaxed, if parsing a typed variable fails, the rest of the parse continues. Examples Simple: // Test without reading a table: range x from 1 to 1 step 1 | parse ""I got 2 socks for my birthday when I was 63 years old"" with * // skip until next match ""got"" counter: long // read a number "" "" // separate fields present // copy string up to next match ""for"" * // skip until next match ""was"" year:long // parse number * // skip rest of string x counter present Year 1 2 socks 63 Relaxed: When the input contains a correct match for every typed column, a relaxed parse produces the same results as a simple parse. But if one of the typed columns doesn't parse correctly, a relaxed parse continues to process the rest of the pattern, whereas a simple parse stops and fails to generate any result. // Test without reading a table: range x from 1 to 1 step 1 | parse kind=""relaxed"" ""I got several socks for my birthday when I was 63 years old"" with * // skip until next match ""got"" counter: long // read a number "" "" // separate fields present // copy string up to next match ""for"" * // skip until next match ""was"" year:long // parse number * // skip rest of string x present Year 1 socks 63 Regex: // Run a test without reading a table: range x from 1 to 1 step 1 // Test string: | extend s = ""Event: NotifySliceRelease (resourceName=Scheduler, totalSlices=27, sliceNumber=16, lockTime=02/17/2016 07:31, releaseTime=02/17/2016 08:41:00, previousLockTime=02/17/2016 06:20:00 ) }"" // Parse it: | parse kind=regex s with "".*?="" resource "", total.*?sliceNumber="" slice:long * ""lockTime="" lock "",.*?releaseTime="" release "",.*?previousLockTime="" previous:date @"".*\)"" * | project-away x, s resource slice lock release previous Scheduler 16 02/17/2016 07:31:00 02/17/2016 08:41 2016-02-17T06:20:00Z project operator T | project cost=price*quantity, price Select the columns to include, rename or drop, and insert new computed columns. The order of the columns in the result is specified by the order of the arguments. Only the columns specified in the arguments are included in the result: any others in the input are dropped. (See also extend .) Syntax T | project ColumnName [= Expression] [, ...] Arguments T: The input table. ColumnName: The name of a column to appear in the output. If there is no Expression , a column of that name must appear in the input. Names are case-sensitive and can contain alphabetic, numeric or '_' characters. Use ['...'] or [""...""] to quote keywords or names with other characters. Expression: Optional scalar expression referencing the input columns. It is legal to return a new calculated column with the same name as an existing column in the input. Returns A table that has the columns named as arguments, and as many rows as the input table. Example The following example shows several kinds of manipulations that can be done using the project operator. The input table T has three columns of type int : A , B , and C . T | project X=C, // Rename column C to X A=2*B, // Calculate a new column A from the old B C=strcat(""-"",tostring(C)), // Calculate a new column C from the old C B=2*B, // Calculate a new column B from the old B ['where'] = client_City // rename, using a keyword as a column name project-away operator T | project-away column1, column2, ... Exclude specified columns. The result contains all the input columns except those you name. range operator range LastWeek from ago(7d) to now() step 1d Generates a single-column table of values. Notice that it doesn't have a pipeline input. LastWeek 2015-12-05 09:10:04.627 2015-12-06 09:10:04.627 ... 2015-12-12 09:10:04.627 Syntax range ColumnName from Start to Stop step Step Arguments ColumnName: The name of the single column in the output table. Start: The smallest value in the output. Stop: The highest value being generated in the output (or a bound on the highest value, if step steps over this value). Step: The difference between two consecutive values. The arguments must be numeric, date or timespan values. They can't reference the columns of any table. (If you want to compute the range based on an input table, use the range function , maybe with the mvexpand operator .) Returns A table with a single column called ColumnName , whose values are Start , Start + Step , ... up to and including Stop . Example range Steps from 1 to 8 step 3 A table with a single column called Steps whose type is long and whose values are 1 , 4 , and 7 . Example range LastWeek from bin(ago(7d),1d) to now() step 1d A table of midnight at the past seven days. The bin (floor) function reduces each time to the start of the day. Example range timestamp from ago(4h) to now() step 1m | join kind=fullouter (traces | where timestamp > ago(4h) | summarize Count=count() by bin(timestamp, 1m) ) on timestamp | project Count=iff(isnull(Count), 0, Count), timestamp | render timechart Shows how the range operator can be used to create a small, ad-hoc, dimension table which is then used to introduce zeros where the source data has no values. reduce operator exceptions | reduce by outerMessage Tries to group together similar records. For each group, the operator outputs the Pattern it thinks best describes that group, and the Count of records in that group. Syntax T | reduce by ColumnName [ with threshold=Threshold ] Arguments ColumnName: The column to examine. It must be of string type. Threshold: A value in the range {0..1}. Default is 0.001. For large inputs, threshold should be small. Returns Two columns, Pattern and Count . In many cases, Pattern will be a complete value from the column. In some cases, it can identify common terms and replace the variable parts with '*'. For example, the result of reduce by city might include: Pattern Count San * 5182 Saint * 2846 Moscow 3726 * -on- * 2730 Paris 27163 render directive T | render [ table | timechart | barchart | piechart | areachart | scatterchart ] [kind= default|stacked|stacked100|unstacked] Render directs the presentation layer how to show the table. It should be the last element of the pipe. It's a convenient alternative to using the controls on the display, allowing you to save a query with a particular presentation method. For some types of chart, kind provides additional options. For example, a stacked barchart segments each bar by a chosen dimension, showing the contribution to the total from different values of the dimension. In a stacked100 chart, every bar is the same height of 100%, so that you can compare the relative contributions. restrict clause Specifies the set of table names available to operators that follow. For example: let e1 = requests | project name, client_City; let e2 = requests | project name, success; // Exclude predefined tables from the union: restrict access to (e1, e2); union * | take 10 sample operator Returns uniformly distributed random rows from the input table. Syntax T | sample NumerOfRows NumberOfRows The number of rows to return in the sample. Tip Use Take when you don't need a uniformly distributed sample. sample-distinct operator Returns a single column that contains up to the specified number of distinct values of the requested column. Does not currently return a fairly distributed sample. Syntax T | sample-distinct NumberOfValues of ColumnName NumberOfValues The length of the table you want. ColumnName The column you want. Tips Can be handy to sample a population by putting sample-distinct in a let statement and later filter using the in operator (see example). If you want the top values rather than just a sample, you can use the top-hitters operator. If you want to sample data rows (rather than values of a specific column), refer to the sample operator . Example Sample a population and do further computation knowing the summarize won't exceed query limits. let sampleops = toscalar(requests | sample-distinct 10 of OperationName); requests | where OperationName in (sampleops) | summarize total=count() by OperationName search operator Search for strings in multiple tables and columns. Syntax search [kind=case_sensitive] [in (TableName, ...)] SearchToken T | search [kind=case_sensitive] SearchToken search [kind=case_sensitive] [in (TableName, ...)] SearchPredicate T | search [kind=case_sensitive] SearchPredicate Finds occurrences of the given token string in any column of any table. TableName Name of a table that is defined globally (requests, exceptions, ...) or by a let clause . You can use wildcards such as r*. SearchToken: A token string, which must match a whole word. You can use trailing wildcards. ""Amster*"" matches ""Amsterdam"", but ""Amster"" does not. SearchPredicate: A Boolean expression over the columns in the tables. You can use ""*"" as a wildcard in column names. Examples search ""Amster*"" //All columns, all tables search name has ""home"" // one column search * has ""home"" // all columns search in (requests, exceptions) ""Amster*"" // two tables requests | search ""Amster*"" requests | search name has ""home"" sort operator T | sort by country asc, price desc Sort the rows of the input table into order by one or more columns. Alias order Syntax T | sort by Column [ asc | desc ] [ , ... ] Arguments T: The table input to sort. Column: Column of T by which to sort. The type of the values must be numeric, date, time or string. asc Sort by into ascending order, low to high. The default is desc , descending high to low. Example Traces | where ActivityId == ""479671d99b7b"" | sort by Timestamp asc All rows in table Traces that have a specific ActivityId , sorted by their timestamp. summarize operator Produces a table that aggregates the content of the input table. requests | summarize count(), avg(duration), makeset(client_City) by client_CountryOrRegion A table that shows the number, average request duration and set of cities in each country. There's a row in the output for each distinct country. The output columns show the count, average duration, cities and country. All other input columns are ignored. T | summarize count() by price_range=bin(price, 10.0) A table that shows how many items have prices in each interval [0,10.0], [10.0,20.0], and so on. This example has a column for the count and one for the price range. All other input columns are ignored. Syntax T | summarize [ [ Column = ] Aggregation [ , ... ] ] [ by [ Column = ] GroupExpression [ , ... ] ] Arguments Column: Optional name for a result column. Defaults to a name derived from the expression. Names are case-sensitive and can contain alphabetic, numeric or '_' characters. Use ['...'] or [""...""] to quote keywords or names with other characters. Aggregation: A call to an aggregation function such as count() or avg() , with column names as arguments. See aggregations . GroupExpression: An expression over the columns, that provides a set of distinct values. Typically it's either a column name that already provides a restricted set of values, or bin() with a numeric or time column as argument. If you provide a numeric or time expression without using bin() , Analytics automatically applies it with an interval of 1h for times, or 1.0 for numbers. If you don't provide a GroupExpression, the whole table is summarized in a single output row. Returns The input rows are arranged into groups having the same values of the by expressions. Then the specified aggregation functions are computed over each group, producing a row for each group. The result contains the by columns and also at least one column for each computed aggregate. (Some aggregation functions return multiple columns.) The result has as many rows as there are distinct combinations of by values. If you want to summarize over ranges of numeric values, use bin() to reduce ranges to discrete values. Note Although you can provide arbitrary expressions for both the aggregation and grouping expressions, it's more efficient to use simple column names, or apply bin() to a numeric column. table operator table('pageViews') The table named in the argument string. Syntax table(tableName) Arguments tableName: A string. The name of a table, which can either be static, or the result of a let clause. Examples table('requests'); let size = (tableName: string) { table(tableName) | summarize sum(itemCount) }; size('pageViews'); take operator Alias of limit top operator T | top 5 by Name desc nulls first Returns the first N records sorted by the specified columns. Syntax T | top NumberOfRows by Sort_expression [ asc | desc ] [nulls first|nulls last] [, ... ] Arguments NumberOfRows: The number of rows of T to return. Sort_expression: An expression by which to sort the rows. It's typically just a column name. You can specify more than one sort_expression. asc or desc (the default) may appear to control whether selection is actually from the ""bottom"" or ""top"" of the range. nulls first or nulls last controls where null values appear. First is the default for asc , last is the default for desc . Tips top 5 by name is superficially equivalent to sort by name | take 5 . However, it runs faster and always returns sorted results, whereas take makes no such guarantee. top-nested operator requests | top-nested 5 of name by count() , top-nested 3 of performanceBucket by count() , top-nested 3 of client_CountryOrRegion by count() | render barchart Produces hierarchical results, where each level is a drill-down from the previous level. It's useful for answering questions that sound like ""What are the top 5 requests, and for each of them, what are the top 3 performance buckets, and for each of them, which are the top 3 countries the requests come from?"" Syntax T | top-nested N of COLUMN by AGGREGATION [, ...] Arguments N:int - number of rows to return or pass to the next level. In a query with three levels where N is 5, 3, and 3, the total number of rows will be 45. COLUMN - A column to group by for aggregation. AGGREGATION - An aggregation function to apply to each group of rows. The results of these aggregations will determine the top groups to be displayed. union operator Table1 | union Table2, Table3 Takes two or more tables and returns the rows of all of them. Syntax T | union [ kind= inner | outer ] [ withsource = ColumnName ] Table2 [ , ...] union [ kind= inner | outer ] [ withsource = ColumnName ] Table1, Table2 [ , ...] Arguments Table1 , Table2 ... The name of a table, such as requests , or a table defined in a let clause ; or A query expression, such as (requests | where success==""True"") A set of tables specified with a wildcard. For example, e* would form the union of all the tables defined in previous let clauses whose name began with 'e', together with the 'exceptions' table. kind : inner - The result has the subset of columns that are common to all of the input tables. outer - The result has all the columns that occur in any of the inputs. Cells that were not defined by an input row are set to null . withsource= ColumnName: If specified, the output will include a column called ColumnName whose value indicates which source table has contributed each row. Use as at the end of each table expression, if you want to specify the name that appears in this column. Returns A table with as many rows as there are in all the input tables, and as many columns as there are unique column names in the inputs. There is no guaranteed ordering in the rows. Example The number of distinct users that have produced either a exceptions event or a traces event over the past 12h. In the result, the 'SourceTable' column will indicate either ""exceptions"" or ""traces"": union withsource=SourceTable kind=outer exceptions, traces | where timestamp > ago(12h) | summarize dcount(user_Id) by SourceTable This more efficient version produces the same result. It filters each table before creating the union: exceptions | where timestamp > ago(24h) | as exceptions | union withsource=SourceTable kind=outer (requests | where timestamp > ago(12h) | as traces) | summarize dcount(user_Id) by SourceTable Use as to specify the name that will appear in the source column. Forcing an order of results Union doesn't guarantee a specific ordering in the rows of results. To get the same order every time you run the query, append a tag column to each input table: let r1 = (traces | count | extend tag = 'r1'); let r2 = (requests | count| extend tag = 'r2'); let r3 = (pageViews | count | extend tag = 'r3'); r1 | union r2,r3 | sort by tag See also Consider the join operator as an alternative. where operator requests | where resultCode==""200"" Filters a table to the subset of rows that satisfy a predicate. Alias filter Syntax T | where Predicate T | where * has Term Arguments T: The tabular input whose records are to be filtered. Predicate: A boolean expression over the columns of T . It is evaluated for each row in T . Term - a string that must match the whole of a word in a column. Returns Rows in T for which Predicate is true . Tips To get the fastest performance: Use simple comparisons between column names and constants. ('Constant' means constant over the table - so now() and ago() are OK, and so are scalar values assigned using a let clause .) For example, prefer where Timestamp >= ago(1d) to where floor(Timestamp, 1d) == ago(1d) . Simplest terms first : If you have multiple clauses conjoined with and , put first the clauses that involve just one column. So Timestamp > ago(1d) and OpId == EventId is better than the other way around. Example traces | where Timestamp > ago(1h) and Source == ""Kuskus"" and ActivityId == SubActivityIt Records that are no older than 1 hour, and come from the Source called ""Kuskus"", and have two columns of the same value. Notice that we put the comparison between two columns last, as it can't utilize the index and forces a scan. Aggregations Aggregations are functions used to combine values in groups created in the summarize operation . For example, in this query, dcount() is an aggregation function: requests | summarize dcount(name) by success any any(Expression) Randomly selects one row of the group and returns the value of the specified expression. This is useful, for example, when some column has a large number of similar values (e.g., an ""error text"" column) and you want to sample that column once per a unique value of the compound group key. Example traces | where timestamp > now(-15min) | summarize count(), any(message) by operation_Name | top 10 by count_level desc argmin, argmax argmin(ExprToMinimize, * | ExprToReturn [ , ... ] ) argmax(ExprToMaximize, * | ExprToReturn [ , ... ] ) Finds a row in the group that minimizes/maximises ExprToMaximize , and returns the value of ExprToReturn (or * to return the entire row). Tip : The passed-through columns are automatically renamed. To make sure you're using the right names, inspect the results using take 5 before you pipe the results into another operator. Examples For each request name, show when the longest request occurred: requests | summarize argmax(duration, timestamp) by name Show all the details of the longest request, not just the timestamp: requests | summarize argmax(duration, *) by name Find the lowest value of each metric, together with its timestamp and other data: metrics | summarize minValue=argmin(value, *) by name avg avg(Expression) Calculates the average of Expression across the group. buildschema buildschema(DynamicExpression) Returns the minimal schema that admits all values of DynamicExpression . The parameter column type should be dynamic - an array or property bag. Example exceptions | summarize buildschema(details) Result: { ""indexer"": {""id"":""string"", ""parsedStack"": { ""indexer"": { ""level"":""int"", ""assembly"":""string"", ""fileName"":""string"", ""method"":""string"", ""line"":""int"" }}, ""outerId"":""string"", ""message"":""string"", ""type"":""string"", ""rawStack"":""string"" }} Notice that indexer is used to mark where you should use a numeric index. For this schema, some valid paths would be (assuming these example indexes are in range): details[0].parsedStack[2].level details[0].message arraylength(details) arraylength(details[0].parsedStack) Example Assume the input column has three dynamic values: {""x"":1, ""y"":3.5} {""x"":""somevalue"", ""z"":[1, 2, 3]} {""y"":{""w"":""zzz""}, ""t"":[""aa"", ""bb""], ""z"":[""foo""]} The resulting schema would be: { ""x"":[""int"", ""string""], ""y"":[""double"", {""w"": ""string""}], ""z"":{""indexer"": [""int"", ""string""]}, ""t"":{""indexer"": ""string""} } The schema tells us that: The root object is a container with four properties named x, y, z and t. The property called ""x"" that could be either of type ""int"" or of type ""string"". The property called ""y"" that could of either of type ""double"", or another container with a property called ""w"" of type ""string"". The indexer keyword indicates that ""z"" and ""t"" are arrays. Each item in the array ""z"" is either an int or a string. ""t"" is an array of strings. Every property is implicitly optional, and any array may be empty. Schema model The syntax of the returned schema is: Container ::= '{' Named-type* '}'; Named-type ::= (name | '""indexer""') ':' Type; Type ::= Primitive-type | Union-type | Container; Union-type ::= '[' Type* ']'; Primitive-type ::= ""int"" | ""string"" | ...; They are equivalent to a subset of the TypeScript type annotations, encoded as a dynamic value. In Typescript, the example schema would be: var someobject: { x?: (number | string), y?: (number | { w?: string}), z?: { [n:number] : (int | string)}, t?: { [n:number]: string } } count count([ Predicate ]) Returns a count of rows for which Predicate evaluates to true . If no Predicate is specified, returns the total number of records in the group. Perf tip : use summarize count(filter) instead of where filter | summarize count() Note Avoid using count() to find the number of requests, exceptions or other events that have occurred. When sampling is in operation, the number of data points retained in Application Insights will be less than the number of original events. Instead, use summarize sum(itemCount)... . The itemCount property reflects the number of original events that are represented by each retained data point. countif countif(Predicate) Returns a count of rows for which Predicate evaluates to true . Perf tip : use summarize countif(filter) instead of where filter | summarize count() Note Avoid using countif() to find the number of requests, exceptions or other events that have occurred. When sampling is in operation, the number of data points will be less than the number of actual events. Instead, use summarize sum(itemCount)... . The itemCount property reflects the number of original events that are represented by each retained data point. dcount dcount( Expression [ , Accuracy ]) Returns an estimate of the number of distinct values of Expr in the group. (To list the distinct values, use makeset .) Accuracy , if specified, controls the balance between speed and accuracy. 0 = the least accurate and fastest calculation. 1 the default, which balances accuracy and calculation time; about 0.8% error. 2 = most accurate and slowest calculation; about 0.4% error. Example pageViews | summarize cities=dcount(client_City) by client_CountryOrRegion dcountif dcountif( Expression, Predicate [ , Accuracy ]) Returns an estimate of the number of distinct values of Expr of rows in the group for which Predicate is true. (To list the distinct values, use makeset .) Accuracy , if specified, controls the balance between speed and accuracy. 0 = the least accurate and fastest calculation. 1 the default, which balances accuracy and calculation time; about 0.8% error. 2 = most accurate and slowest calculation; about 0.4% error. Example pageViews | summarize cities=dcountif(client_City, client_City startswith ""St"") by client_CountryOrRegion makelist makelist(Expr [ , MaxListSize ] ) Returns a dynamic (JSON) array of all the values of Expr in the group. MaxListSize is an optional integer limit on the maximum number of elements returned (default is 128 ). makeset makeset(Expression [ , MaxSetSize ] ) Returns a dynamic (JSON) array of the set of distinct values that Expr takes in the group. (Tip: to just count the distinct values, use dcount .) MaxSetSize is an optional integer limit on the maximum number of elements returned (default is 128 ). Example pageViews | summarize cities=makeset(client_City) by client_CountryOrRegion See also the mvexpand operator for the opposite function. max, min max(Expr) Calculates the maximum of Expr . min(Expr) Calculates the minimum of Expr . Tip : This gives you the min or max on its own - for example, the highest or lowest price. But if you want other columns in the row - for example, the name of the supplier with the lowest price - use argmin or argmax . percentile, percentiles, percentilew, percentilesw percentile(Expression, Percentile) Returns an estimate for Expression of the specified percentile in the group. The accuracy depends on the density of population in the region of the percentile. percentiles(Expression, Percentile1 [ , Percentile2 ...] ) Like percentile() , but calculates a number of percentile values (which is faster than calculating each percentile individually). percentilew(Expression, WeightExpression, Percentile) Weighted percentile. Use this for pre-aggregated data. WeightExpression is an integer that indicates how many original rows are represented by each aggregated row. percentilesw(Expression, WeightExpression, Percentile1, [, Percentile2 ...]) Like percentilew() , but calculates a number of percentile values. Examples The value of duration that is larger than 95% of the sample set and smaller than 5% of the sample set, calculated for each request name: request | summarize percentile(duration, 95) by name Omit ""by..."" to calculate for the whole table. Simultaneously calculate several percentiles for different request names: requests | summarize percentiles(duration, 5, 20, 50, 80, 95) by name The results show that for the request /Events/Index, 5% of requests are responded to in less than 2.44s, half of them in 3.52s, and 5% are slower than 6.85s. Calculate multiple statistics: requests | summarize count(), avg(Duration), percentiles(Duration, 5, 50, 95) by name Weighted percentiles Use the weighted percentile functions in cases where the data has been pre-aggregated. For example, suppose your app performs many thousands of operations per second, and you want to know their latency. The simple solution would be to generate an Application Insights request or custom event for each operation. This would create a lot of traffic, although adaptive sampling would take effect to reduce it. But you decide to implement an even better solution: you will write some code in your app to aggregate the data before sending it to Application Insights. The aggregated summary will be sent at regular intervals, reducing the data rate perhaps to a few points per minute. Your code takes a stream of latency measurements in milliseconds. For example: { 15, 12, 2, 21, 2, 5, 35, 7, 12, 22, 1, 15, 18, 12, 26, 7 } It counts the measurements in the following bins: { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 } Periodically, it makes a series of TrackEvent calls, one for each bucket, with custom measurements in each call: foreach (var latency in bins.Keys) { telemetry.TrackEvent(""latency"", null, new Dictionary<string, double> ({""latency"", latency}, {""opCount"", bins[latency]}}); } In Analytics, you see one such group of events like this: opCount latency meaning 8 10 = 8 operations in the 10ms bin 6 20 = 6 operations in the 20ms bin 3 30 = 3 operations in the 30ms bin 1 40 = 1 operations in the 40ms bin To get an accurate picture of the original distribution of event latencies, we use percentilesw : customEvents | summarize percentilesw(latency, opCount, 20, 50, 80) The results are the same as if we had used plain percentiles on the original set of measurements. Note Weighted percentiles are not applicable to sampled data , where each sampled row represents a random sample of original rows, rather than a bin. The plain percentile functions are appropriate for sampled data. Estimation error in percentiles The percentiles aggregate provides an approximate value using T-Digest . A few important points: The bounds on the estimation error vary with the value of the requested percentile. The best accuracy is at the ends of [0..100] scale, percentiles 0 and 100 are the exact minimum and maximum values of the distribution. The accuracy gradually decreases towards the middle of the scale. It is worst at the median and is capped at 1%. Error bounds are observed on the rank, not on the value. Suppose percentile(X, 50) returned value of Xm. The estimation guarantees that at least 49% and at most 51% of the values of X are less than Xm. There is no theoretical limit on the difference between Xm and actual median value of X. stdev stdev(Expr) Returns the standard deviation of Expr over the group. variance variance(Expr) Returns the variance of Expr over the group. sum sum(Expr) Returns the sum of Expr over the group. Scalars casts | comparisons gettype | hash | iff | isnull | isnotnull | notnull | toscalar The supported types are: Type Additional name(s) Equivalent .NET type bool boolean System.Boolean datetime date System.DateTime dynamic System.Object guid uuid , uniqueid System.Guid int System.Int32 long System.Int64 double real System.Double string System.String timespan time System.TimeSpan Casts You can cast from one type to another. In general, if the conversion makes sense, it will work: todouble(10), todouble(""10.6"") toint(10.6) == 11 floor(10.6) == 10 toint(""200"") todatetime(""2016-04-28 13:02"") totimespan(""1.5d""), totimespan(""1.12:00:00"") toguid(""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"") tostring(42.5) todynamic(""{a:10, b:20}"") Check whether a string can be converted to a specific type: iff(notnull(todouble(customDimensions.myValue)), ..., ...) Scalar comparisons < Less <= Less or Equals > Greater >= Greater or Equals <> Not Equals != Not Equals in Right operand is a (dynamic) array and left operand is equal to one of its elements. !in Right operand is a (dynamic) array and left operand is not equal to any of its elements. gettype Returns A string representing the underlying storage type of its single argument. This is particularly useful when you have values of kind dynamic : in this case gettype() will reveal how a value is encoded. Examples gettype(""a"") ""string"" gettype(111) ""long"" gettype(1==1) ""int8"" gettype(now()) ""datetime"" gettype(1s) ""timespan"" gettype(parsejson('1')) ""int"" gettype(parsejson(' ""abc"" ')) ""string"" gettype(parsejson(' {""abc"":1} ')) ""dictionary"" gettype(parsejson(' [1, 2, 3] ')) ""array"" gettype(123.45) ""real"" gettype(guid(12e8b78d-55b4-46ae-b068-26d7a0080254)) ""guid"" gettype(parsejson('')) ""null"" gettype(1.2)==real true hash Syntax hash(source [, mod]) Arguments source : The source scalar the hash is calculated on. mod : The modulo value to be applied on the hash result. Returns The xxhash (long)value of the given scalar, modulo the given mod value (if specified). Examples hash(""World"") // 1846988464401551951 hash(""World"", 100) // 51 (1846988464401551951 % 100) hash(datetime(""2015-01-01"")) // 1380966698541616202 iff The iff() function evaluates the first argument (the predicate), and returns either the value of either the second or third arguments depending on whether the predicate is true or false . The second and third arguments must be of the same type. Syntax iff(predicate, ifTrue, ifFalse) Arguments predicate: An expression that evaluates to a boolean value. ifTrue: An expression that gets evaluated and its value returned from the function if predicate evaluates to true . ifFalse: An expression that gets evaluated and its value returned from the function if predicate evaluates to false . Returns This function returns the value of ifTrue if predicate evaluates to true , or the value of ifFalse otherwise. Example iff(floor(timestamp, 1d)==floor(now(), 1d), ""today"", ""anotherday"") isnull, isnotnull, notnull isnull(parsejson("""")) == true Takes a single argument and tells whether it is null. Syntax isnull([value]) isnotnull([value]) notnull([value]) // alias for isnotnull Returns True or false depending on the whether the value is null or not null. x isnull(x) """" false ""x"" false parsejson("""") true parsejson(""[]"") false parsejson(""{}"") false Example T | where isnotnull(PossiblyNull) | count Notice that there are other ways of achieving this effect: T | summarize count(PossiblyNull) toscalar Evaluates a query or an expression and returns the result as a single value. This function is useful for staged calculations; for example, calculating a total count of events and then using that as a baseline. Syntax toscalar(query) toscalar(scalar) Returns The evaluated argument. If the argument is a table, returns the first column of the first row. (Good practice is to arrange that the argument has only one column and row.) Example // Get the count of requests 5 days ago: let baseline = toscalar(requests | where floor(timestamp, 1d) == floor(ago(5d),1d) | count); // List the counts relative to that baseline: requests | summarize daycount = count() by floor(timestamp, 1d) | extend relative = daycount - baseline Boolean Literals true == 1 false == 0 gettype(true) == ""int8"" typeof(bool) == typeof(int8) Boolean operators and or Convert to boolean If you have a string aStringBoolean that contains a value ""true"" or ""false"", you can convert it to Boolean as follows: booleanResult = aStringBoolean =~ ""true"" Numbers abs | bin | exp | floor | gamma | log | rand | range | sqrt | todouble | toint | tolong Numeric literals 42 long 42.0 real Arithmetic operators + Add - Subtract * Multiply / Divide % Modulo < Less <= Less or Equals > Greater >= Greater or Equals <> Not Equals != Not Equals abs Syntax abs(x) Arguments x - an integer, real or timespan Returns iff(x>0, x, -x) bin, floor Rounds values down to an integer multiple of a given bin size. Used a lot in the summarize by query. If you have a scattered set of values, they will be grouped into a smaller set of specific values. Alias floor . Syntax bin(value, roundTo) floor(value, roundTo) Arguments value: A number, date, or timespan. roundTo: The ""bin size"". A number, date or timespan that divides value . Returns The nearest multiple of roundTo below value . (toint(value/roundTo)) * roundTo Examples Expression Result bin(4.5, 1) 4.0 bin(time(16d), 7d) 14d bin(datetime(1953-04-15 22:25:07), 1d) datetime(1953-04-15) The following expression calculates a histogram of durations, with a bucket size of 1 second: T | summarize Hits=count() by bin(Duration, 1s) exp exp(v) // e raised to the power v exp2(v) // 2 raised to the power v exp10(v) // 10 raised to the power v floor An alias for bin() . gamma The gamma function Syntax gamma(x) Arguments x: A real number For positive integers, gamma(x) == (x-1)! For example, gamma(5) == 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 . See also loggamma . log log(v) // Natural logarithm of v log2(v) // Logarithm base 2 of v log10(v) // Logarithm base 10 of v v should be a real number > 0. Otherwise, null is returned. loggamma The natural logarithm of the absolute value of the gamma function . Syntax loggamma(x) Arguments x: A real number rand A random number generator. rand() - a real number between 0.0 and 1.0 rand(n) - an integer between 0 and n-1 sqrt The square root function. Syntax sqrt(x) Arguments x: A real number >= 0. Returns A positive number such that sqrt(x) * sqrt(x) == x null if the argument is negative or cannot be converted to a real value. toint toint(100) // cast from long toint(20.7) == 20 // nearest int below double toint(20.4) == 20 // nearest int below double toint("" 123 "") // parse string toint(a[0]) // cast from dynamic toint(b.c) // cast from dynamic todouble todouble(20) == 20.0 // conversion from long or int todouble("" 12.34 "") // parse string todouble(a[0]) // cast from dynamic todouble(b.c) // cast from dynamic tolong tolong(20.7) == 20 // conversion from double tolong(20.4) == 20 // conversion from double tolong("" 123 "") // parse string tolong(a[0]) // cast from dynamic tolong(b.c) // cast from dynamic Numeric series series_fir | series_fit_line | series_fit_2lines | series_iir | series_periods | series_stats series_fir The series_fir() function applies a Finite Impulse Response filter on a series (which is represented by a dynamic column containing numeric array). By specifying the filter coefficients, it can be used for calculating moving average, smoothing, change-detection and many more use cases. The function takes as input the column containing the dynamic array and a static dynamic array of the filter's coefficients and applies the filter on the column. It outputs a new dynamic array column, containing the filtered output. Syntax series_fir(x, filter [, normalize[, center]]) Arguments x: Dynamic array cell which is an array of numeric values, typically the resulting output of make-series or makelist operators. filter: An optional Boolean value indicating whether the filter coefficients should be normalized (i.e. divided by the sum). By default, normalize is true. If filter contains negative values, auto normalization cannot be done and normalize must be explicitly set to false. normalize: Optional Boolean value indicating whether the filter should be normalized. By default normalize is true. If filter contains negative values then normalize must be specified as false. center: An optional Boolean value indicating whether the filter is applied symmetrically on a time window before and after the current point, or on a time window from the current point backwards. By default, center is false, which fits the scenario of streaming data, where we can only apply the filter on the current and older points; however, for ad-hoc processing you can set it to true, keeping it synchronized with the time series (see examples below). Technically speaking, this parameter controls the filter’s group delay. Examples Calculating a moving average of 5 points can be performed by setting filter=[1,1,1,1,1] and normalize=true (default). Note the effect of center=false (default) vs. true: range t from bin(now(), 1h)-23h to bin(now(), 1h) step 1h | summarize t=makelist(t) | project id='TS', val=dynamic([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,20,40,100,40,20,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]), t | extend 5h_MovingAvg=series_fir(val, dynamic([1,1,1,1,1])), 5h_MovingAvg_centered=series_fir(val, dynamic([1,1,1,1,1]), true, true) | render timechart This query returns: 5h_MovingAvg: 5 points moving average filter. The spike is smoothed and its peak shifted by (5-1)/2 = 2h. 5h_MovingAvg_centered: same but with setting center=true, causes the peak to stay in its original location. (To see multiple lines, deselect 'split' in the chart controls.) Calculating the difference between a point and its preceding one can be performed by setting filter=[1,-1]: range t from bin(now(), 1h)-11h to bin(now(), 1h) step 1h | summarize t=makelist(t) | project id='TS',t,value=dynamic([0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3]) | extend diff=series_fir(value, dynamic([1,-1]), false, false) | render timechart series_fit_line The series_fit_line() function takes a column containing dynamic numerical array as input and performs linear regression in order to find the line that best fits it. This function should be used on time series arrays, fitting the output of make-series operator. It generates a dynamic column containing the following fields: slope: slope of the approximated line (this is a from y=ax+b ). interception: interception of the approximated line (this is b from y=ax+b ). rsquare: r-square is a standard measure of the fit quality. It's a number in the range [0-1], where 1 is the best possible fit, and 0 means the data is totally unordered and do not fit any line. variance: variance of the input data. rvariance: residual variance which is the variance between the input data values the approximated ones. line_fit: numerical array holding a series of values of the best fitted line. The series length is equal to the length of the input array. It is mainly used for charting. The most convenient way of using this function is applying it to results of make-series operator. Syntax series_fit_line(x) Arguments x: Dynamic array of numeric values. Note that the function expects all rows to have equal number of array elements. Otherwise empty results will be returned. Examples range x from 1 to 1 step 1 | project id=' ', x=range(bin(now(), 1h)-11h, bin(now(), 1h), 1h), y=dynamic([2,5,6,8,11,15,17,18,25,26,30,30]) | extend (s,i,rs,v,rv,LineFit)=series_fit_line(y) | render timechart Slope Interception RSquare Variance RVariance LineFit 0.982 2.730 98.628 1.686 -1.666 1.064, 3.7945, 6.526, 9.256, 11.987, 14.718, 17.449, 20.180, 22.910, 25.641, 28.371, series_fit_2lines The series_fit_2lines() function applies two segments linear regression on a (time) series in order to identify and quantify trend change in a series. The function iterates on the series indexes and in each iteration splits the series to 2 parts, fits a separate line (using series_fit_line()) to each part and calculate the total r-square. The best split is the one that maximized r-square; the function returns its parameters: rsquare: r-square is a standard measure of the fit quality. It's a number in the range [0-1], where 1 - is the best possible fit, and 0 means the data is totally unordered and do not fit any line split_idx: the index of breaking point to 2 segments (zero-based) variance: variance of the input data rvariance: residual variance which is the variance between the input data values the approximated ones (by the 2 line segments). line_fit: numerical array holding a series of values of the best fitted line. The series length is equal to the length of the input array. It is mainly used for charting. right_rsquare: r-square of the line on the right side of the split, see series_fit_line() right_slope: slope of the right approximated line (this is a from y=ax+b) right_interception: interception of the approximated left line (this is b from y=ax+b) right_variance: variance of the input data on the right side of the split right_rvariance: residual variance of the input data on the right side of the split left_rsquare: r-square of the line on the left side of the split, see series_fit_line() left_slope: slope of the left approximated line (this is a from y=ax+b) left_interception: interception of the approximated left line (this is b from y=ax+b) left_variance: variance of the input data on the left side of the split left_rvariance: residual variance of the input data on the left side of the split Note that this function returns multiple columns therefore it cannot be used as an argument for another function. Syntax project series_fit_2lines(x) Will return all mentioned above columns with the following names: series_fit_2lines_x_rsquare, series_fit_2lines_x_split_idx and etc. project (rs, si, v)=series_fit_2lines(x) Will return the following columns: rs (r-square), si (split index), v (variance) and the rest will look like: series_fit_2lines_x_rvariance, series_fit_2lines_x_line_fit etc. extend (rs, si, v)=series_fit_2lines(x) Will return only: rs (r-square), si (split index) and v (variance). Arguments x: Dynamic array of numeric values. The most convenient way of using this function is applying it to results of make-series operator. Examples range x from 1 to 1 step 1 | project id=' ', x=range(bin(now(), 1h)-11h, bin(now(), 1h), 1h), y=dynamic([1,2.2, 2.5, 4.7, 5.0, 12, 10.3, 10.3, 9, 8.3, 6.2]) | extend (Slope,Interception,RSquare,Variance,RVariance,LineFit)=series_fit_line(y), (RSquare2, SplitIdx, Variance2,RVariance2,LineFit2)=series_fit_2lines(y) | project id, x, y, LineFit, LineFit2 | render timechart series_iir The series_iir() function applies an Infinite Impulse Response filter on a series (which is represented by a dynamic column containing numeric array). By specifying the filter coefficients, it can be used for example to calculate the cumulative sum of the series, to apply smoothing operations, as well as various high-pass, band-pass and low-pass filters. The function takes as input the column containing the dynamic array and two static dynamic arrays of the filter's a and b coefficients, and applies the filter on the column. It outputs a new dynamic array column, containing the filtered output. Syntax series_iir(x, b , a) Arguments x: Dynamic array cell which is an array of numeric values, typically the resulting output of make-series or makelist operators. b: A constant expression containing the numerator coefficients of the filter (stored as a dynamic array of numeric values). a: A constant expression, like b. Containing the denominator coefficients of the filter. The first element of a (i.e. a[0]) mustn’t be zero (to avoid division by 0; see the formula below). More about the filter’s recursive formula Given an input array X and coefficients arrays a, b of lengths n_a and n_b respectively, the transfer function of the filter, generating the output array Y, is defined by (see also in Wikipedia): Y[i] = 1/a[0] * ( b[0]*X[i] + b[1]*X[i-1] + … + b[n_b-1]*X[i-n_b-1] — a[1]*Y[i-1] – a[2]*Y[i-2] – … – a[n_a-1]*Y[i-n_a-1] ) Examples Calculating cumulative sum can be performed by iir filter with coefficients a=[1,-1] and b=[1]: let x = range(1.0, 10, 1); range t from 1 to 1 step 1 | project x=x, y = series_iir(x, dynamic([1]), dynamic([1,-1])) | mvexpand x, y x y 1.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 6.0 4.0 10.0 series_periods The series_periods() function finds the most significant periods that exist in a time series. For example, very often a metric measuring an application’s traffic is characterized by two significant cycles: a weekly and a daily. Given such a time series, series_periods() shall detect these 2 dominant periods. The function takes as input a column containing a dynamic array of time series (typically the resulting output of make-series operator), two real numbers defining the minimal and maximal period size (i.e. number of bins, e.g. for 1h bin the size of a daily period would be 24) to search for, and a long number defining the total number of periods for the function to search. The output is a dynamic array containing the size of the periods which have been found, ordered by the significance of the periods in the data. Syntax series_periods(x, min_period, max_period, num_periods)` Arguments x: Dynamic array cell which is an array of numeric values, typically the resulting output of make-series or makelist operators. min_period: A real number specifying the minimal period to search for. max_period: A real number specifying the maximal period to search for. num_periods: A long number specifying the maximum required number of periods. This will be the length of the output dynamic array. Important notes The algorithm behind series_periods() requires at least 4 points in a period to detect it. Therefore, the minimal value for min_period is 4. If min_period is set to a lower value, the function will replace it by 4. The maximal value for max_period is half of the length of the input series. If max_period is set to a higher value, the function will clip it to that value. As mentioned above, the resulting periods are in the units of the binning, e.g. if the original series has daily period and was aggregated by hourly bins, a daily period in the output will be 24; if the data is aggregated by minute, the output will be 60*24=1440. You should set the min_period a little below and max_period a little above the periods you expect to find in the time series. For example, if you have an hourly-aggregated signal, and you look for both daily and weekly periods (that would be 24 & 168 respectively) you can set min_period=0.824, max_period=1.2 168. The length of the output dynamic array is num_of_periods; if the function has found less than num_of_periods significant periods, the rest of the array entries will be set to 0. The input time series must be regular, i.e. aggregated in constant bins (which is always the case if it has been created using make-series). Otherwise, the output is meaningless. Example As an example, the following query embeds a snapshot of a month of an application’s traffic, aggregated twice a day (i.e. every 12 hours). range x from 1 to 1 step 1 | project y=dynamic([80,139,87,110,68,54,50,51,53,133,86,141,97,156,94,149,95,140,77,61,50,54,47,133,72,152,94,148,105,162,101,160,87,63,53,55,54,151,103,189,108,183,113,175,113,178,90,71,62,62,65,165,109,181,115,182,121,178,114,170]) | project x=range(1, arraylength(y), 1), y | render linechart Running series_periods() on this series results in the weekly period (14 points long): range x from 1 to 1 step 1 | project y=dynamic([80,139,87,110,68,54,50,51,53,133,86,141,97,156,94,149,95,140,77,61,50,54,47,133,72,152,94,148,105,162,101,160,87,63,53,55,54,151,103,189,108,183,113,175,113,178,90,71,62,62,65,165,109,181,115,182,121,178,114,170]) | project x=range(1, arraylength(y), 1), y | project periods = series_periods(y, 4.0, 50.0, 2) periods [14.0, 0.0] series_stats The series_stats() function takes a column containing dynamic numerical array as input and calculates the following columns: min: minimum value in the input array min_idx: maximum value in the input array max: maximum value in the input array max_idx: maximum value in the input array average: average value of the input array variance: sample variance of input array stdev: sample standard deviation of the input array Note that this function returns multiple columns therefore it cannot be used as an argument for another function. Syntax project series_stats(x) Returns all mentioned above columns with the following names: serie_stats_x_min, series_stats_x_min_idx etc. project (m, mi)=series_stats(x) Returns the following columns: m (min), mi (min_idx) and the rest will look like series_stats_x_max, series_stats_x_line_max_idx etc. extend (m, mi)=series_stats(x) Returns only: m (min) and mi (min_idx).

For this schema, some valid paths would be (assuming these example indexes are in range): details[0].parsedStack[2].level details[0].message arraylength(details) arraylength(details[0].parsedStack) Array and object literals To create a dynamic literal, use parsejson (alias todynamic ) with a JSON string argument: parsejson('[43, 21, 65]') - an array of numbers parsejson('{""name"":""Alan"", ""age"":21, ""address"":{""street"":432,""postcode"":""JLK32P""}}') parsejson('21') - a single value of dynamic type containing a number parsejson('""21""') - a single value of dynamic type containing a string Note Double-quotes ( "" ) must be used to enclose labels and string values in JSON. Therefore, it is generally easier to quote a JSON-encoded string literals using single-quotes ( ' ). This example creates a dynamic value and then uses its fields: T | extend person = parsejson('{""name"":""Alan"", ""age"":21, ""address"":{""street"":432,""postcode"":""JLK32P""}}') | extend n = person.name, add = person.address.street Dynamic object functions value in array array contains value value !in array array does not contain value arraylength( array ) Null if it isn't an array extractjson( path,object ) Uses path to navigate into object. parsejson( source ) Turns a JSON string into a dynamic object. range( from,to,step ) An array of values mvexpand listColumn Replicates a row for each value in a list in a specified cell. summarize buildschema( column ) Infers the type schema from column content summarize makelist( column ) Flattens groups of rows and puts the values of the column in an array. summarize makeset( column ) Flattens groups of rows and puts the values of the column in an array, without duplication. Dynamic objects in let clauses Let clauses store dynamic values as strings, so these two clauses are equivalent, and both need the parsejson (or todynamic ) before being used: let list1 = '{""a"" : ""somevalue""}'; let list2 = parsejson('{""a"" : ""somevalue""}'); T | project parsejson(list1).a, parsejson(list2).a in value in (listExpression) value !in (listExpression) Determines whether there is (not) an item in the list that is equal to the value. Case-sensitive, where the value is a string. Arguments value : A scalar expression. listExpression ...: A list of scalar expressions, or an expression that evaluates to a list. A nested array is flattened into a single list - for example, where x in (dynamic([1,[2,3]])) becomes where x in (1,2,3) . Examples requests | where client_City in (""London"", ""Paris"", ""Rome"") let cities = dynamic(['Dublin','Redmond','Amsterdam']); requests | where client_City in (cities) | summarize count() by client_City Computed list: let topCities = toscalar ( // convert single column to value requests | summarize count() by client_City | top 4 by count_ | summarize makeset(client_City)) ; requests | where client_City in (topCities) | summarize count() by client_City; Using a function call as the list expression: let topCities = (n:int) {toscalar ( requests | summarize count() by client_City | top n by count_ | summarize makeset(client_City)) }; requests | where client_City in (topCities(3)) | summarize count() by client_City; arraylength The number of elements in a dynamic array. Syntax arraylength(array) Arguments array: A dynamic value. Returns The number of elements in array , or null if array is not an array. Examples arraylength(parsejson('[1, 2, 3, ""four""]')) == 4 arraylength(parsejson('[8]')) == 1 arraylength(parsejson('[{}]')) == 1 arraylength(parsejson('[]')) == 0 arraylength(parsejson('{}')) == null arraylength(parsejson('21')) == null extractjson extractjson(""$.hosts[1].AvailableMB"", EventText, typeof(int)) Get a specified element out of a JSON text using a path expression. Optionally convert the extracted string to a specific type. Syntax string extractjson(jsonPath, dataSource)?? resulttype extractjson(jsonPath, dataSource, typeof(resulttype))?? Returns This function performs a JsonPath query into dataSource which contains a valid JSON string, optionally converting that value to another type depending on the third argument. Example The [bracket] notation and dot notation are equivalent: ... | extend AvailableMB = extractjson(""$.hosts[1].AvailableMB"", EventText, typeof(int)) | ... ... | extend AvailableMD = extractjson(""$['hosts'][1]['AvailableMB']"", EventText, typeof(int)) | ... Performance tips Apply where-clauses before using extractjson() Consider using a regular expression match with extract instead. This can run very much faster, and is effective if the JSON is produced from a template. Use parsejson() if you need to extract more than one value from the JSON. Consider having the JSON parsed at ingestion by declaring the type of the column to be dynamic. JSON Path expressions $ Root object @ Current object [0] Array subscript . or [0] Child (We don't currently implement wildcards, recursion, union, or slices.) parsejson Interprets a string as a JSON value ) and returns the value as dynamic . It is superior to using extractjson() when you need to extract more than one element of a JSON compound object. Syntax parsejson(json) Arguments json: A JSON document. Returns An object of type dynamic specified by json . Example In the following example, customDimensions.person is a string that looks like this: ""\""addresses\"":[{\""postcode\"":\""C789\"",\""street\"":\""high st\"",\""town\"":\""Cardigan\""},{\""postcode\"":\""J456\"",\""street\"":\""low st\"",\""town\"":\""Jumper\""}],\""name\"":\""Ada\"""" then the following fragment retrieves the value of the duration slot in the object, and from that it retrieves two slots, duration.value and duration.min ( 118.0 and 110.0 , respectively). customEvents | where name == ""newMember"" | extend d=parsejson(context_custom_metrics) | extend duration_value=d.duration.value, duration_min=d[""duration""][""min""] Note Double-quote characters must be used to enclose labels and string values in JSON. range The range() function (not to be confused with the range operator) generates a dynamic array holding a series of equally-spaced values. Syntax range(start, stop, step) Arguments start: The value of the first element in the resulting array. stop: The value of the last element in the resulting array, or the least value that is greater than the last element in the resulting array and within an integer multiple of step from start . step: The difference between two consecutive elements of the array. Examples The following example returns [1, 4, 7] : range(1, 8, 3) The following example returns an array holding all days in the year 2015: range(datetime(2015-01-01), datetime(2015-12-31), 1d) todynamic todynamic('{""a"":""a1"", ""b"":[""b1"", ""b2""]}') Converts a string to a dynamic value. treepath treepath(dynamic_object) Enumerates all the path expressions that identify leaves in a dynamic object. Returns An array of path expressions. Examples treepath(parsejson('{""a"":""b"", ""c"":123}')) => [""['a']"",""['c']""] treepath(parsejson('{""prop1"":[1,2,3,4], ""prop2"":""value2""}')) => [""['prop1']"",""['prop1'][0]"",""['prop2']""] treepath(parsejson('{""listProperty"":[100,200,300,""abcde"",{""x"":""y""}]}')) => [""['listProperty']"",""['listProperty'][0]"",""['listProperty'][0]['x']""] Note that ""[0]"" indicates the presence of an array, but does not specify the index used by a specific path. zip zip(list1, list2, ...) Combines a set of lists into one list of tuples. list1... : A list of values Examples zip(parsejson('[1,3,5]'), parsejson('[2,4,6]')) => [ [1,2], [3,4], [5,6] ] zip(parsejson('[1,3,5]'), parsejson('[2,4]')) => [ [1,2], [3,4], [5,null] ] Names Names can be up to 1024 characters long. They are case-sensitive and may contain letters, digits and underscores ( _ ). Quote a name using [' ... '] or ["" ... ""] to include other characters or use a keyword as a name. For example: requests | summarize [""distinct urls""] = dcount(name) // non-alphanumerics by ['where'] = client_City, // using a keyword as a name ['outcome!'] = success // non-alphanumerics ['path\file\n\'x\''] Use \ to escape characters [""d-e.=/f#\n""] [@'path\file'] No escapes - \ is literal [@""\now & then\""] [where] Using a language keyword as a name Analytics Overview Tour of Analytics Start here.

34," Analytics - Wikipedia Analytics From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For the ice hockey term, see Analytics (ice hockey) . Analytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data . Especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information, analytics relies on the simultaneous application of statistics , computer programming and operations research to quantify performance. Organizations may apply analytics to business data to describe, predict, and improve business performance. Specifically, areas within analytics include predictive analytics , prescriptive analytics , enterprise decision management , retail analytics, store assortment and stock-keeping unit optimization, marketing optimization and marketing mix modeling , web analytics , sales force sizing and optimization, price and promotion modeling, predictive science, credit risk analysis , and fraud analytics . Since analytics can require extensive computation (see big data ), the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the most current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics. [1] Contents 1 Analytics vs. analysis 2 Application of Analytics 2.1 Marketing optimization 2.2 People analytics 2.3 Portfolio analytics 2.4 Risk analytics 2.5 Digital analytics 2.6 Security analytics 2.7 Software analytics 3 Challenges 4 Risks 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Analytics vs. analysis [ edit ] Analytics is multidisciplinary . There is extensive use of mathematics and statistics, the use of descriptive techniques and predictive models to gain valuable knowledge from data—data analysis. The insights from data are used to recommend action or to guide decision making rooted in business context. Thus, analytics is not so much concerned with individual analyses or analysis steps, but with the entire methodology . There is a pronounced tendency to use the term analytics in business settings e.g. text analytics vs. the more generic text mining to emphasize this broader perspective. [ citation needed ] . There is an increasing use of the term advanced analytics , [ citation needed ] typically used to describe the technical aspects of analytics, especially in the emerging fields such as the use of machine learning techniques like neural networks to do predictive modeling . Application of Analytics [ edit ] Marketing optimization [ edit ] Marketing has evolved from a creative process into a highly data-driven process. Marketing organizations use analytics to determine the outcomes of campaigns or efforts and to guide decisions for investment and consumer targeting. Demographic studies, customer segmentation, conjoint analysis and other techniques allow marketers to use large amounts of consumer purchase, survey and panel data to understand and communicate marketing strategy. Web analytics allows marketers to collect session-level information about interactions on a website using an operation called sessionization . Google Analytics is an example of a popular free analytics tool that marketers use for this purpose. Those interactions provide web analytics information systems with the information necessary to track the referrer, search keywords, identify IP address, and track activities of the visitor. With this information, a marketer can improve marketing campaigns, website creative content, and information architecture. Analysis techniques frequently used in marketing include marketing mix modeling, pricing and promotion analyses, sales force optimization and customer analytics e.g.: segmentation. Web analytics and optimization of web sites and online campaigns now frequently work hand in hand with the more traditional marketing analysis techniques. A focus on digital media has slightly changed the vocabulary so that marketing mix modeling is commonly referred to as attribution modeling in the digital or marketing mix modeling context. These tools and techniques support both strategic marketing decisions (such as how much overall to spend on marketing, how to allocate budgets across a portfolio of brands and the marketing mix) and more tactical campaign support, in terms of targeting the best potential customer with the optimal message in the most cost effective medium at the ideal time. People analytics [ edit ] This application of analytics helps companies manage human resources . The aim is to discern which employees to hire, which to reward or promote, what responsibilities to assign, and similar human resource problems. [2] For example, an analysis may find that individuals that fit a certain type of profile are those most likely to succeed at a particular role, making them the best employees to hire. Portfolio analytics [ edit ] A common application of business analytics is portfolio analysis . In this, a bank or lending agency has a collection of accounts of varying value and risk . The accounts may differ by the social status (wealthy, middle-class, poor, etc.) of the holder, the geographical location, its net value, and many other factors. The lender must balance the return on the loan with the risk of default for each loan. The question is then how to evaluate the portfolio as a whole. The least risk loan may be to the very wealthy, but there are a very limited number of wealthy people. On the other hand, there are many poor that can be lent to, but at greater risk. Some balance must be struck that maximizes return and minimizes risk. The analytics solution may combine time series analysis with many other issues in order to make decisions on when to lend money to these different borrower segments, or decisions on the interest rate charged to members of a portfolio segment to cover any losses among members in that segment. Risk analytics [ edit ] Predictive models in the banking industry are developed to bring certainty across the risk scores for individual customers. Credit scores are built to predict individual’s delinquency behavior and widely used to evaluate the credit worthiness of each applicant. Furthermore, risk analyses are carried out in the scientific world and the insurance industry. It is also extensively used in financial institutions like Online Payment Gateway companies to analyse if a transaction was genuine or fraud. For this purpose they use the transaction history of the customer. This is more commonly used in Credit Card purchase, when there is a sudden spike in the customer transaction volume the customer gets a call of confirmation if the transaction was initiated by him/her. This helps in reducing loss due to such circumstances. Digital analytics [ edit ] Digital analytics is a set of business and technical activities that define, create, collect, verify or transform digital data into reporting, research, analyses, recommendations, optimizations, predictions, and automations. [3] This also includes the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) where the keyword search is tracked and that data is used for marketing purposes. Even banner ads and clicks come under digital analytics. A growing number of brands and marketing firms rely on digital analytics for their digital marketing assignments, where MROI (Marketing Return on Investment) is an important key performance indicator (KPI). Security analytics [ edit ] Security analytics refers to information technology (IT) solutions that gather and analyze security events to bring situational awareness and enable IT staff to understand and analyze events that pose the greatest risk. [4] Solutions in this area include security information and event management solutions and user behavior analytics solutions. Software analytics [ edit ] Main article: Software analytics Software analytics is the process of collecting information about the way a piece of software is used and produced. Challenges [ edit ] In the industry of commercial analytics software, an emphasis has emerged on solving the challenges of analyzing massive, complex data sets, often when such data is in a constant state of change. Such data sets are commonly referred to as big data . Whereas once the problems posed by big data were only found in the scientific community, today big data is a problem for many businesses that operate transactional systems online and, as a result, amass large volumes of data quickly. [5] The analysis of unstructured data types is another challenge getting attention in the industry. Unstructured data differs from structured data in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation. [6] Sources of unstructured data, such as email, the contents of word processor documents, PDFs, geospatial data, etc., are rapidly becoming a relevant source of business intelligence for businesses, governments and universities. [7] For example, in Britain the discovery that one company was illegally selling fraudulent doctor's notes in order to assist people in defrauding employers and insurance companies, [8] is an opportunity for insurance firms to increase the vigilance of their unstructured data analysis. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that big data analysis could save the American health care system $300 billion per year and the European public sector €250 billion. [9] These challenges are the current inspiration for much of the innovation in modern analytics information systems, giving birth to relatively new machine analysis concepts such as complex event processing , full text search and analysis, and even new ideas in presentation. [10] One such innovation is the introduction of grid-like architecture in machine analysis, allowing increases in the speed of massively parallel processing by distributing the workload to many computers all with equal access to the complete data set. [11] Analytics is increasingly used in education , particularly at the district and government office levels. However, the complexity of student performance measures presents challenges when educators try to understand and use analytics to discern patterns in student performance, predict graduation likelihood, improve chances of student success, etc. For example, in a study involving districts known for strong data use, 48% of teachers had difficulty posing questions prompted by data, 36% did not comprehend given data, and 52% incorrectly interpreted data. [12] To combat this, some analytics tools for educators adhere to an over-the-counter data format (embedding labels, supplemental documentation, and a help system, and making key package/display and content decisions) to improve educators’ understanding and use of the analytics being displayed. [13] One more emerging challenge is dynamic regulatory needs. For example, in the banking industry, Basel III and future capital adequacy needs are likely to make even smaller banks adopt internal risk models. In such cases, cloud computing and open source R (programming language) can help smaller banks to adopt risk analytics and support branch level monitoring by applying predictive analytics. [ citation needed ] Risks [ edit ] This article possibly contains original research . Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations . Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (March 2015) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The main risk for the people is discrimination like price discrimination or statistical discrimination . There is also the risk that a developer could profit from the ideas or work done by users, like this example: Users could write new ideas in a note taking app, which could then be sent as a custom event, and the developers could profit from those ideas. This can happen because the ownership of content is usually unclear in the law. [14] If a user's identity is not protected, there are more risks; for example, the risk that private information about users is made public on the internet. In the extreme, there is the risk that governments could gather too much private information, now that the governments are giving themselves more powers to access citizens' information.

At Hitachi, we support digital transformation through long-term co-creation with our clients. It’s part of our commitment to you to solve your business problems and create new value. Our analytics are already accelerating the digital transformation of clients in many business fields. Engineering work and expertise can now be automated and passed on to others through digitization and data analytics. Engineering expertise plays a vital role in optimizing manufacturing work and formulating production plans. But because it is highly specialized, this knowledge has always been difficult to define and apply to wider, more efficient uses. Now, through the continuous analysis made possible by Hitachi analytics, your company is able to automate and digitize this expertise to use it in more areas of your business. For example, we helped a manufacturing company digitally reproduce 86% of the work involved in formulating production plans that was previously done by proficient engineers. As a result, they were able to raise quality and shorten development cycles in more areas of their business. It’s just one of the many challenges Hitachi has taken on as we continue to find new opportunities in automation. Facilities and equipment serve as the foundation of many industries. You can implement effective prevention and maintenance measures by discovering early signs of failure through an analysis of operational data. All businesses rely on the efficiency of their facilities and equipment. In order to operate at the highest efficiency, organizations must minimize the downtime caused by malfunctions and other factors. With analytics, we’re able to proactively predict failures by collecting and analyzing the data from these operational technologies. By implementing prevention and maintenance measures before mishaps occur, we can help make the best operational use of facilities, equipment and even whole businesses. Damages from increasing numbers of security breaches can be minimized by time series analysis of a wide variety of data. According to the report, Global State of Information Security , worldwide security incidents increased 38% in 2015 compared to the previous year. These breaches result in an astounding economic loss of hundreds of billion dollars per year. To help protect you from these catastrophic damages, our first step is to determine the causes of security threats. We do this with time series analysis through a comprehensive process that merges a variety of data from many different sources of information. Hitachi’s analytics are supported by diverse technologies and physical support Our Data Analytics Meister Service helps customers create innovation through a group of experts who possess both business knowledge and data analysis intelligence. Big data is big business. Hitachi helps you use big data to grow in the new digital economy by starting with a deeper understanding of advanced analysis products and information and communications technology (ICT) products. But we don’t stop there. In addition to this innovative analytics approach, Hitachi also provides consulting through our Data Analytics Meister Service. Our Data Analytics Meister—a specialist in big data utilization—gives you a full walkthrough of the analytics process from start to finish. This comprehensive service advances through four phases: (1) Design a vision and set a goal. (2) Formulate a utilization scenario, in which a scenario for realizing the vision is developed—clarifying the value that will be created. (3) Verify the practical use in which the data analysis method is established and its efficacy is verified. (4) Implement the system, to apply the final execution. Our team works closely with you to help you through every stage of the analytics process. Pentaho is an analytics solution that integrates operational data and big data, enabling you to analyze your business from all angles.

The program is a hosted shared service provided by GSA’s Technology Transformation Service . On November 8, 2016, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum on Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services , which requires federal agencies to implement the DAP javascript code on all public facing federal websites. The program consists of: A no-cost, federal-wide Web analytics tool Training Past recorded trainings on our YouTube channel Future training found on our events page Implementation support DAP FAQs Implementation instructions Most recent code available in the DAP Github repo On-going help-desk and data reporting support A public window into some DAP data at analytics.usa.gov Want to fork our dashboard? See our Github repo Digital Metrics guidance and best practices Benefits and Features No-cost, hosted website analytics Provides comprehensive, easy-to-use analytics for every section of your online presence. Delivers broad overviews and in-depth insights that apply to programs across your agency. Scalable to handle a broad range of .gov sites (large and small). Allows instantaneous access to a targeted set of critical performance data. Meets agency compliance with OMB reporting on the 10 Minimum Common Baseline Performance Metrics for Milestone 8.2 . Hosted service by GSA avoids duplication of agencies purchasing the same tool and going through separate procurements. Quick, reliable, and secure infrastructure Delivers instant analytics for up-to-the minute site awareness. GSA’s signed Terms of Service agreement provides legal framework for using the tool. Data insights across agencies Using a common analytics tool across federal agencies will deliver an unprecedented, government-wide view of how well agencies serve their customers through the Web. Participation from 45 agencies offers data from a variety of types of websites within government. See agency participation at pulse.cio.gov . Making analytic data more accessible will create new possibilities for agencies to collaborate to improve services. Participating in the Program Any federal agency can sign up to use the common Web analytics tool. Here’s how it works: Agencies define a DAP point of contact (POC). GSA will send the agency POC a short, sign-up form to register their agency and work with them to implement the common page tag code. GSA will provide implementation support, access to training, and other resources to agency POCs. If you don’t have an identified POC, send us an email . Gaining access to DAP If your agency participates in the program, you can request access to the data by emailing us . We’ll send you instructions and a short registration form, and notify your agency POC. After you complete the form, we’ll grant you access and get you started! You can view the most common questions about the program and learn more about incorporating the Digital Analytics Tool into your current metrics program .

Tips & Tricks Google Analytics and tracking Related to: Metrics You can easily add your Google Analytics tracking code to any of your typeforms, in order to track visitor behavior and demographics. The steps to follow are: On your Google Analytics home page, select the account you want to integrate your typeform with and copy the property ID behind the name/URL of that account. It takes the form UA-XXXXX-Y or UA-XXXXX-YY. Log in to your Typeform account, open up the typeform you want to track and go to the Analyze panel. In the Google Analytics section paste your code and click the button Add to typeform . Open your typeform a couple of times, answer your questions if you feel like it. Open your Google Analytics account where you are tracking the typeform. Go to the Content panel, open Site Content section and click on All Pages . Get your typeform’s URL and copy its ID. It’s the last string of characters in the URL, after the last “/”, and should be something similar to xxXxXX. Use the typeform ID in the search tool of the All Pages report. Beardy warning! If you followed all the steps above, but still can’t see the data, check if there is filtering turned on in the Admin > View settings > Filters of your Google Analytics Account. Typeforms are loaded from a different domain than your main website, so you should make sure that it is not filtered out of the reports. Remember that it will take Google Analytics a few hours to update the tracking data, so you may have to wait to see it working. Please also note that embedded typeforms with the same tracking code as their hosting webpage will be counted twice (one count for both the form and the website for each visit will appear in your Google Analytics metrics under two different URLs). If you use Hidden Fields in your typeform, the ID is the string between the last “/” and the “?” character. Beardy Warning! If you add your Google Analytics tracking code to a typeform, you are responsible for the data collected by Google Analytics. If you’re using hidden fields that include personally identifiable information, like name or email address, etc, you must ensure this information is added to the ‘Exclude URL Query Parameters’ field in Google Analytics’ view settings. Collecting this data breaks Google’s Terms of Service. Here’s how to do this: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1010249?hl=en Tracking conversions On every submit of your typeforms we are also sending a Google Analytics event with the following parameters: Category for your typeform’s UID, Action for “TypeformSubmit” and Label for the name of your typeform. You can find all the typeform submits in Google Analytics in the Behavior > Events > Top events report . To see how to use this event to set up Goals (for easier use in other reports, like conversion tracking), please refer to this Google Analytics help article . Tracking drop-off Each time your respondent answers a question, we trigger a Google Analytics event with the following parameters: Category for your typeform’s UID Action for “TypeformQuestionPassed” Label for the question title You can find all your typeform’s “Questions Passed” events in Google Analytics under Behavior > Events > Top Events report. If you want to figure out where respondents drop off, click on “Unique Events” to see which question has the fewest answers. Take note: statement fields are not tracked! This is a great way to track points where respondents drop off. Then you can revise your questions to try to improve your typeform’s completion rate. Remember these 4 steps to an awesome typeform !

In addition to visitor analytics, you can monitor threats and search engine crawlers. For most websites, these threats and crawlers make up 20% to 50% of traffic. It’s traffic every website should understand, but most analytics services ignore.

With Cloudflare, you get insight into all visitors coming to your site, even the threats. Powerful Threat Control The threat control panel shows you suspicious visitors by country origin, type, IP address and severity. The threat control panel is easy to manage. You can add or remove IPs, IP ranges, and countries to your Trust or Block list. Search Engine Crawlers Cloudflare makes it easy for you to track which search engine crawlers are coming to your website. It’s simple to see what bandwidth search engine crawlers consume and how that changes over time. DNS Analytics Gain valuable insight and visibility into DNS query traffic. Filter and visualize data using a variety of metrics and dimensions. See what names people are looking for on your site that don’t exist. View aggregate traffic for a specific domain or by DNS record. Real Time Traffic For real-time insights into visitors on your website now, Cloudflare analytics update daily or in real-time, depending on the plan you choose. Augment With Third Party Analytics Cloudflare has partnered with the most popular analytics programs. You can get other analytics services through our apps marketplace with one click. There is no hardware or software to install, so you can be up and running instantly. GeoIP Cloudflare includes the geographic location of your visitor so you can see which countries your visitors are coming from. Rate Limiting Rate Limiting gives you granular controls to detect bad traffic, customized rulesets to ensure that your legitimate visitors are not impacted, and insights to improve your security posture as attacks evolve. Compatible With All Analytics Programs Cloudflare works with popular analytics programs, including Google Analytics. Cloudflare augments all the information that you already love from your current analytics solution with new information that you can’t get anywhere else.
