Speaking to reporters in Nagpur, Mr. Athawle also praised the Narendra Modi government “for its three years of commendable work” and said that the Dalits were voting in large numbers for the BJP. “Narendra Modi’s leadership has made it difficult for any other party to emerge now. Even the Dalits are voting for the BJP which is why it is winning almost everywhere. It is a party of Bahujans now. The central government has done a lot of work in last three years and took tough decisions like the demonetisation which benefited more than 80% population of the country. The Prime Minister has also increased funds for the memorials of Dr. Ambedkar. He keenly follows Dr. Ambedkar’s economic policies,” Mr. Athawale, one of the most prominent Dalit leaders in the Modi cabinet, told reporters. ‘Saharanpur incident unfortunate, but BJP can’t be blamed for it’ However, Mr. Athawale conceded that the Dalits were facing atrocities in many parts of the country but he refused to blame the central or the BJP-ruled State governments for the violence against Dalits. “Dalits are facing atrocities. The recent case of Saharanpur shows it but it is wrong to link it with the new BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. Even the Samajwadi Party’s government witnessed violence against the Dalits. Uttar Pradesh is a State known for violence and nowadays the Dalits are also reacting to the atrocities against them. But such things should not happen. There should be harmony among all the communities. I would again reiterate that the state governments are not responsible for such incidents and these clashes are taking place because of caste rivalries. What happened in Saharanpur should not have happened,” he said. Accusing the Congress of “spreading rumours” against the Modi government, Mr. Athawale said: “The Congress party is anxious and frustrated because of losing power and it is making false allegations that the government wants to change the Constitution and repeal the reservation of the Dalits. “The Constitution will never be changed. Only some amendments can be made. Our Constitution is perfect. The reservation for Dalits will also stay. Those, who demand to repeal the reservation on the basis of caste, should make sure that the caste is repealed first. The RSS and the BJP will never change anything in the constitution. The Prime Minister has clearly said that the Constitution is his religious book,” the RPI leader added.

Several Dalit homes were burnt by Rajputs earlier this month in clashes sparked by a Rajput procession through a Dalit area. A Rajput man was killed in the violence. All India | Written by Sreenivasan Jain (with inputs from Manas Pratap Singh) | Updated: May 28, 2017 09:22 IST 399 Shares EMAIL PRINT COMMENTS Saharanpur: In his palatial home in Saharanpur, in western Uttar Pradesh, the BJP lawmaker from here Raghav Lakhanpal is confronted by an angry group of Rajput men. They are relatives of 11 young men arrested by the UP police on charges of attacking Dalits who were returning from Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati rally earlier this week. One Dalit boy was shot dead, 15 were badly injured in the latest chapter in a cycle of sectarian violence that has rocked this region for close to a month now. The Rajputs, who consider themselves a core political base of the BJP, seem shaken by the arrests. They claim that their boys are innocent and must be released from jail. ""Five people from one family (have been picked up). Are they all terrorists?"" Mangeram Pundhir, from whose house five men were arrested, asked Mr Lakhanpal. The violence has uncovered the BJP's dilemma - while Rajputs constitute a loyal base, the party cannot afford to antagonise Dalits, whose increasing support played a key role in delivering a massive mandate to the party. ""Be patient,"" urged Mr Lakhanpal, attempting to calm his angry constituents. ""How can we be calm"", asked Mr Pundhir, his voice cracked with emotion. Mr Lakhanpal assured the Rajputs that he had told the police to conduct a fair inquiry. ""I have told the police anyone who is guilty should not be spared,"" he said, ""but there should be no wrong charges."" Equally, Mr Lakhanpal has to allay fears amongst Dalits that the BJP is not partial to Rajputs. ""We need to sit the communities down, we need to get rid of all those tensions and make sure that they co-exist peacefully in the future,"" he told NDTV. But both communities seem unhappy with the manner in which the administration has dealt with the unrest. The Rajputs, who we spoke to after the meeting, had a clear message for the BJP. ""If we do not get justice, why would we vote for the BJP?,"" says Mr Pundhir. ""The situation could be very different in 2019 (Lok Sabha elections),"" he said. Home Ministry had rushed 400 riot-control policemen to Saharanpur on Thursday Later, we traveled to Shabbirpur, the village of Dalits and Rajputs south of Saharanpur town that emerged as an epicentre for the cascading violence. Several Dalit homes were burnt by Rajputs earlier this month in clashes sparked by a Rajput procession through a Dalit area. A Rajput man was killed in the violence. Here, the Dalits, otherwise traditional BSP loyalists, said that they voted for the BJP in the recent assembly elections. But they too issued a veiled threat. ""This incident will directly affect the BJP,"" said Jagpal, a resident of the village. For better or worse, we asked? ""Only time will tell,"" he said.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You By Amulya Ganguli There is a long way to go before Uttar Pradesh can become Uttam Pradesh, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised after his party's massive victory in the assembly elections. The caste violence in Saharanpur and the gang rape and murder on a highway near Bulandshahr have followed the depredations of the love jehad and anti-Romeo squads and the Allahabad High Court's intervention in favour of the Muslim meat traders when it told Yogi Adityanath's government to issue licences to the abattoirs which it had summarily closed down. The government's crackdown on the slaughterhouses on the grounds that many of them were unlicensed was seen as a step specifically aimed at the Muslim community which has been traditionally associated with the Rs 15,000 crore industry. The high court, however, said that a ""check on unlawful activity should be simultaneous with facilitating the carrying of lawful activity, particularly that relating to food, food habits and vending thereof that is undisputedly connected with the right to life and livelihood"". But even as meat is again available in Lucknow and other cities and there has been a marginal decline in the targeting of those involved in inter-faith romances, an even greater challenge has emerged for the law-enforcing authorities in the caste conflicts between Dalits and Thakurs in the Saharanpur area. The fact that the Chief Minister himself is a Thakur hasn't helped in restoring amity between the two communities, especially when overzealous officials told the Mushahars, another Dalit group, to wash themselves with soap and use deodorants before Yogi Adityanath visited their Mainpur Kot village in Kushinagar district. A similar incident occurred when the Chief Minister went to the home of a martyred BSF jawan where an air-conditioner was temporarily installed and a sofa put in place during the visit. Together with the violence in Saharanpur, these incidents have caused a further strain in the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) relations with the Dalits, which suffered a major setback when a bright Dalit scholar, Rohith Vemula, committed suicide in Hyderabad central university in January last year following skirmishes between his group, the Ambedkar Students' Association, and the BJP 's student wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). There was a further blow to the BJP's outreach to the Dalits when the gau rakshaks (cow vigilantes) lynched a group of Dalits for skinning a cow, their traditional occupation, in Una in Gujarat. The fallout of these incidents has been the emergence of a new generation of Dalit leaders like the 30-year-old lawyer, Chandrashekhar Azad ""Ravan"", who led the so-called Bhim Army (named after the Dalit icon, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar) for protests against the Saharanpur violence in Delhi's Jantar Mantar. Apart from anything else, his call for a Dalit-Muslim-backward caste alliance against the BJP aims at undercutting Modi's tactic of bringing the non-Jatav Dalits and non-Yadav backward castes to the BJP's fold, which yielded handsome dividends for the party in the Uttar Pradesh assembly election by leaving only the Jatavs and Yadavs with Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav , respectively, thereby fracturing the Dalit and OBC vote banks of the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party . Irrespective of how politically successful will be the young idealists like ""Ravan"" and Jignesh Mevani, who led the Dalit protests against the Una floggings, they appear to have succeeded so far in sidelining established leaders like Mayawati, who no longer seem to be able to reach out to the youths in the community. For the BJP, the worry will be that its hope of showcasing Uttar Pradesh as a model state, especially where law and order and the safety of women are concerned, may come a cropper. Already a minister, Suresh Khanna, has said that the state is too big to ensure ""zero crime"", which can nullify the party's charges against the previous government. The expectation that Yogi Adityanath will live up to his reputation of being tough has been nullified up to now even as the Dalit-Thakur violence has reinforced the BJP's image as an upper caste party. While the Muslims initially bore the brunt of saffron aggression, it is the Dalits who now have reasons to be aggrieved. The fairly large gathering at Jantar Mantar showed how members of the community from states other than Uttar Pradesh have become agitated over the Saharanpur incidents. The possibility, therefore, of an incipient Dalit-Muslim-backward caste combine being formed cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the fact that such an alliance will not be a quiescent one is evident from the flaunting of epithets like the Great Chamar, a previously pejorative term which has now become a badge of honour. For the BJP, the developments in Uttar Pradesh have cast a shadow over the third anniversary celebrations of its assumption of office at the Centre. It is obvious that the party simply cannot afford to alienate yet another community, viz., the Dalits, when the Muslims may have distanced themselves even further from the party in the wake of the ghar wapsi and love jehad campaigns by the saffron brotherhood aimed at making them ""return"" to Hinduism and against Hindu-Muslim affairs and marriages.

5," Saharanpur caste violence: Eye on local polls, BJP walks the tightrope between Dalits and Thakurs | india-news | Hindustan Times e-paper India Follow us: Today in New Delhi , India May 28, 2017-Sunday - °C New Delhi Humidity - Wind - select city Metro cities - Delhi Mumbai Chennai Kolkata Other cities - Noida Gurgaon Bengaluru Hyderabad Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Lucknow Patna Ranchi Powered by Close india world cities opinion ct 2017 sports entertainment lifestyle business tech education whatnow photos videos jaago re Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Mycollegesabroad Desimartini Studymate Englishmate Saharanpur caste violence: Eye on local polls, BJP walks the tightrope between Dalits and Thakurs Chunks of Dalit votes buoyed the BJP during its recent Uttar Pradesh assembly election sweep. But now, the caste clashes have jeopardised the community’s support for the saffron party. india Updated: May 27, 2017 12:52 IST Niha Masih Hindustan Times, Saharanpur Locals point to the municipal elections in Saharanpur this year as one of the causes of the caste clashes. (PTI) Three deaths, more than a dozen injured and 71 arrests later, a tenuous calm has fallen across Shabbirpur village in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur district After caste violence rocks the area for over 20 days, the local BJP MLA from Deoband, Kunwar Brijesh Singh. is on his first visit to the locality on Thursday. Clad in an orange hued kurta, Singh sits surrounded by the Thakurs of the village. He is quick to blame Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati’s visit on the latest round of violence on May 23. One Dalit man was killed and 13 injured in attacks on those returning from Mayawati’s public meeting. Dismissing it, he fuels the conspiracy theory mentioned by upper caste villagers of masked men (not Thakurs) having attacked the Dalits. His sympathies become clearer when questioned about the Dalit houses torched by the Thakurs. Several people loudly say the Dalits burnt their own houses to blame the Thakurs. Singh nods in agreement, “A reporter trying to shoot this was manhandled as well.” He is quickly checked by a man sitting next to him who says, “I am saying this, not the MLA ji.” Singh retracts, “I wasn’t here that day. People are saying that, I cannot say authentically.” That does not stop him from pinning the blame on his political rivals. “This is a fight between Bhim Army and BSP. Both worry the other will take over and that’s why this happened,” he says. We asked if he would visit the affected Dalits in the village as well, but he leaves soon after despite telling us he would. The caste faultlines exposed by the Shabbirpur incident may not be new but have now been bared as politics takes centrestage. Locals point to the municipal elections to be held in Saharanpur this year as one of the causes of the unrest. This is the first time that elections for the local body will be held. While such local polls never resonated nationally, the BJP’s aggressive campaign in the Delhi municipal elections have brought such contests into sharp focus. The BJP holds the Saharanpur Lok Sabha seat but it lost 3 of the 5 assembly seats even though it swept most of the Western UP region in the 2017 state elections. It lost the Saharanpur city and rural seats which are due to vote in the municipal polls but managed to pull in a chunk of Dalit votes. Saharanpur has traditionally been a BSP bastion but the party failed to win even a single assembly seat this year. With a 40 percent Muslim population in the district, the Dalits which constitute 21 percent are key to the fortunes of both parties. The two parties have taken to accusing each other for instigating the violence for political gain. Caught in this political vortex are the constituents and a fledgling Dalit youth organisation, the Bhim Army. 15 days before the Shabbirpur incident, Saharanpur BJP MP, Raghav Lakhanpal’s Ambedkar Shobha Yatra, in Sadak Dudhli village through a Muslim area, without police permission had triggered a round of violence. The unrest fueled as the MP openly issued a threat to the then SSP Luv Kumar while BJP workers attacked the officer’s house. The SSP was transferred out of the district soon after. Lakhanpal’s actions were seen as an attempt to drive a wedge between the Dalits and Muslims. While there maybe no ostensible connection to Sadak Dudhli and Shabbirpur incidents, a video of Chandrashekhar, the firebrand leader of the Bhim Army had surfaced online in its wake, addressing Dalits and Muslims. He warns them against the BJP saying, “it only wants to incite communal violence for electoral gains.” Lakhanpal is quick to dismiss this. “Let’s not make this a Dalit-BJP issue. This issue is about a handful of people who are trying to mislead the community, trying to show a different picture.” The BJP has been caught in a bind in trying to assuage their core Thakur base without alienating the Dalits. Lakhanpal’s doublespeak doesn’t last long as a group of incensed Thakurs from Ambetta village arrive. Their children have been arrested for attacking Dalits after Mayawati’s public meeting on May 23. Lakhanpal assures them, “anyay nahi hone denge.” (We won’t let injustice happen.) Police in action after violence broke out during an Ambedkar Jayanti Shobhayatra in Saharanpur carried out by BJP MP Raghav Lakhanpal. (PTI) We meet more Thakur families outside the district jail. Saroj Pundhir, is waiting with a plastic bag of clothes and a box of puri-sabzi for her son, Rohit, one of those arrested. She says that their village is 10 km away from Shabbirpur and none of the boys were involved in the attacks on Dalits. The anger against the administration soon turns into anger against the BJP government. “Vote toh BJP ko kiya tha par agar hamare begunah bacchon ko pakdenge toh inko dobara kyun vote denge.” (We voted for the BJP but if they jail our innocent kids, we won’t vote for them again). Not too far away, in the Civil Hospital trauma centre are another set of BJP voters – the Dalits who were attacked by the Thakurs. A frail Inderpal, 50, has his head and both hands bandaged. “When I was crossing the Rajput houses, about 10-15 men with swords and axes attacked me. I pleaded saying, “what’s my mistake” but they called me “gittal” (a local castiest slur) and kept beating me,” he says. Another man cuts in, “This is the result of having voted for the BJP. They don’t care for chamars, only the cow.” A third says, “Caste oppression is not new but now it’s their (upper caste) government so they can do what they want. The only difference is that this time we will raise our voice.” This wave of Dalit assertion has been fired by the Bhim Army, a two-year-old organisation founded in nearby Chutmalpur, in response to caste oppression of Dalit children at school. The national convenor of the organisation, Vinay Ratan Singh, a strapping young man with a handlebar moustache says it is easy for parties to pin the blame on them. Chandrashekhar, founder of Bhim Army, during a protest at Jantar-Mantar in New Delhi on Sunday. (Ravi Choudhary/HT PHOTO) “Our only clash was with the administration on May 9, nothing else. Every little accident is now being blamed on us. We are being called so many names but they can go see our work on ground,” he says referring to the after school program run by them for Dalit students. Targeting them has also led to a surge of mass support for them. At a protest called by them on May 21, thousands descended onto Delhi. Chandrashekhar made a quick appearance despite the looming threat of arrest. Local police sources say that arresting more Bhim Army members at this point could further worsen the situation. “Jab bhi SC ke sath anyay hoga Bhim Army puri takat ke saath khadi hogi, pure disesh or videsh mein bhi.” (The Bhim Army will stand in full strength every time there will be injustice with Scheduled Castes, nationally and even internationally). Vinay says while they will continue their fight they have told their cadre to not break the law. But the simmering anger of the cadre is clear when we met a few of the young men of Bhim Army checking on the injured Dalits being treated at the Civil Hospital. Pointing to Inderpal one says, “Inhi ke bache andar hain, aur yahi aspatal mein. Ladai toh ab dikhayenge kaisi hoti hai. Kaise sadkon pe aate hain log.” (His sons have been arrested and he is the one injured too. We’ll show how to fight by taking to the streets). Another young man from Chhutmalpur village, the birthplace of Bhim Army loudly says, “Abhi to ek Chandrashekhar hai, jab 100 Chandrashekhar ho jayenge na, phir dekhiyega.” (Right now, there is one Chandrashekhar, when there will be 100, you will see). more from india Maoists threaten to kill judge who awarded death penalty to five Maoists in Bihar May 28, 2017 10:33 IST Three Zika cases detected in India: Causes, symptoms and prevention May 28, 2017 10:27 IST Not a Drop to Waste- A Water Day Infographic Partnered Feature Recommended for you Read more Saharanpur clashes: Suspended cop was indicted over Muzaffarnagar riots Rahul Gandhi leaves for Saharanpur, authorities say won’t let him in Read more Why Saharanpur caste violence is bad news for Yogi Adityanath and BJP Saharanpur: Uneasy calm at ground zero, over 24 arrested for inciting violence India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

7," Non-BJP parties in Kerala fume over new cattle slaughter rules | Business Line Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio National Science Sports World Variety Education Real Estate Cities4Climate Non-BJP parties in Kerala fume over new cattle slaughter rules V Sajeev Kumar/Vinson Kurian comments · print · T+ · T- Tweet VS Sunil Kumar, State Agriculture Minister, said Kerala will not accept the new Central order — cattle trade regulation is after all a State subject. Thiruvananthapuram/Kochi, May 26: Barring the BJP, political parties have come out strongly against the Centre’s move to impose the new Regulation of Livestock Markets Rules, 2017, saying it violates the principles of federalism. The Centre has banned the sale and purchase of cattle from animal markets for slaughter. According to the notification, the member secretary of an animal market committee will have to ensure that no person brings a young animal to the animal market. In Kerala, State BJP president Kummanam Rajasekharan said the original intent is to prevent slaughter of cattle stock acquired for agricultural purposes. It is wrong to attribute the move to other motives based on purely political calculations, he added. The relevant government order makes it clear that there is no restriction on either owning or rearing cattle for meat or eating beef. Rajasekharan’s colleague and general secretary of the State unit of the party K Surendran welcomed the new rules. Grand design Meanwhile, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the Central notification is part of the grand design to implement the larger RSS agenda across the country. It is intended to kill the spirit of unity among diversity, he said. Lakhs of people in the country are known to consume animal meat, and it is not confined to a few communities either. The Centre seem to have ignored the fact that animal meat is the source of essential protein to a large population, said Vijayan, adding that the new regulation needs to be opposed by all political parties. He feared that if this does not come about, and also in good time, the Centre could well proceed to ban the consumption of even fish in the country. VS Sunil Kumar, State Agriculture Minister, said Kerala will not accept the new Central order — cattle trade regulation is after all a State subject. KT Jaleel, Minister for Local Self-Government, too aired stiff resistance to the Centre’s proposal. CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan saw an ‘RSS agenda’ behind the move. Senior leaders of the Congress in the State, including Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and MM Hassan, president of the State unit of the party, too have harshly criticised the Centre. Far-reaching impact The Centre's decision could also hit the prospects of Kerala-based Meat Products of India (MPI). The State-owned entity is all set to open a ?31-crore, high-tech plant at Koothattukulam near Kochi on Saturday, that has the capacity to slaughter 200 animals a day. “The notification will have a far-reaching impact on the company’s future plans, as 30 per cent of the production requirement comes from cattle and buffaloes,” AS Biju Lal, MPI Managing Director, told BusinessLine . With the ban coming into effect, there would be restrictions in the availability of animals for slaughter to meet production requirements. MPI normally depends on farmers in Kerala as well as neighbouring Tamil Nadu. At present, the production of buffalo meet and beef is 20 tonnes per month. This is expected to go up once the high-tech plant starts operations, he said.

The BJP has been in talks for alliance with the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) in preparation for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections which is going to be held in seven phases between February 11 and March 8. It has also included Apna Dal MP Anupriya Patel in the BJP-led Union Cabinet, possibly with an eye on getting 'Kurmi' votes in the election-bound state. According to sources, the SBSP has demanded 46 seats from BJP in eastern UP though they expect to get at least 22. The Apna Dal has also given a list of around 50 seats to the BJP and is expecting to get at least 20. Interestingly, the BJP has not yet declared its chief-ministerial candidate. Opinion polls are divided on which party is going to win the next Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. Nonetheless, it is apparent that the SP, BSP and BJP are the three main contenders in the fray. In the last Assembly elections held in 2012, the SP ousted incumbent BSP by winning absolute majority.

His son, Utkarsh Maurya's name had already figured in the second list as a BJP candidate from Unchahar. The list also includes Dara Singh Chauhan contesting from Madhuban and RK Chaudhary from Mohanlalganj, both of whom have also joined the BJP from BSP. For the remaining 33 seats, the BJP is reportedly in talks with some allies. BJP Second List of Candidates for Uttar Pradesh Assembly Election 2017 BJP has released the list of 155 candidates for the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. The prominent among the list are Pankaj Singh, son of home minister Rajnath Singh, Rita Bahuguna Joshi who had left the congress to join the BJP and Sidharth Nath Singh. So far the BJP has released the list of 304 candidates in Uttar Pradesh which has the 403-membr house. Interestingly so far no Muslim have been given a ticket and when general secretary Arun Singh was asked by media about the absence of the Muslim candidate he simply replied that no suitable candidate was available. Apart from this BJP has also given the ticket to Garima Singh, wife of Congress MP Sanjay Singh. Arun Singh talking to the media said that party would get two-third majority in the state and form the government.

RAMA KRISHNA | Hyderabad | 27 May, 2017 Tweet K. Chandrasekhar Rao The TRS chief had not entertained an invitation from Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s office for ‘consultations’. Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has decided to support the BJP’s candidate in the upcoming Presidential elections. His Telangana Rashtra Samithi has 15 Lok Sabha MPs, three Rajya Sabha MPs, 92 MLAs and 24 MLCs. He convened a TRS MPs’ and MLAs’ meet at Telangana Bhavan, Saturday where he was authorised to announce the decision at the right time. With this, the ruling BJP led NDA at the Centre can hope to sweep both the Telugu states—Telangana and Andhra Pradesh—in the presidential elections. In Andhra Pradesh, as both ruling TDP and sole opposition party, YSR Congress have decided to back the BJP, all the votes will be go to the NDA nominee. The opposition camp can only hope to get the votes of Congress’ one Lok Sabha MP and 15 MLAs and MIM’s one MP and seven MLAs. This is a major achievement for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose personal equations with KCR and YSR Congress chief Jagan Mohan Reddy, both of whom are not part of the NDA, have tilted the scales in favour of the BJP in the crucial presidential elections. KCR’s decision to back the BJP has surprised many as it came within hours after BJP president Amit Shah wrapped up his three-day political tour of Telangana on Thursday night. Shah had attacked the TRS government in Telangana, saying that the CM had failed to properly spend the around Rs 1 lakh crore funds given by the Centre. Shah, whose eyes are set on increasing the BJP’s fortunes in Telangana, also attacked KCR for foisting “family rule” and vowed to oppose his recent decision to give 12% reservations to Muslims. KCR retaliated strongly by saying that the state had got only around Rs 22,000 crore Central funds. KCR pointed out that Telangana was one of the richest states in India which contributes to the overall revenues of the Central exchequer. KCR said he was ready to quit his post, if Shah proved his charges of misuse of funds. But in a surprise move, KCR announced he would stand by the BJP in the presidential elections. He not only conveyed his decision to the key aides of the PM in New Delhi, but also informed the same to Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan by calling on him at the Raj Bhawan on Thursday night. KCR has been dropping hints that he would not be a part of the Congress led opposition camp in the presidential elections. He had not entertained invitation from Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s office for consultations on the presidential elections sometime back. KCR also stayed away from the opposition’s dinner meeting at Sonia Gandhi’s residence on Friday. Sources close to the CM told The Sunday Guardian that the decision to keep away from the Congress led opposition camp was a calibrated move, not a sudden one. “We have been on the same page with the BJP on several key issues including the recent GST Bill and demonetisation,” said a corporation chairman preferring anonymity. KCR once again praised the PM for running a corruption-free government in the last three years and claimed that he too was providing a corruption free administration in Telangana. Seniors in TRS are of the view that KCR’s stand to be with the PM on almost all major issues, while fighting the BJP locally, was a well thought out move. KCR is not ready to go for an open alliance with the BJP in the coming elections as he considers Congress as his main rival in Telangana. If he joins hands with the BJP, the Muslim vote, which is estimated to be around 11%, would go to the Congress. Moreover, BJP, with a weak state level leadership, is not in a position to take on the TRS, which is strongly entrenched in all the state’s 31 districts. Any open alliance between the TRS and the BJP would lead to demands for more seats from the saffron brigade, sources close to the CM said. In spite of its best efforts, the BJP’s state level leaders couldn’t attract any seniors from the TRS, Congress or the TDP. When asked about possible defections from TRS to the BJP, KCR termed it as the “joke of the millennium”.

Results: Panvel (Halfway mark is 39 seats of total 78) BJP: 51, PWP: 23, NCP: 2, Congress: 2, Shiv Sena: 0, Others: 0 Malegaon: (Halfway mark is 42 seats of total 84) Congress: 28; NCP + JD(S): 27; Shiv Sena: 13, BJP: 9, AIMIM: 7, Others: 7 Bhiwandi (Halfway mark is 45 seats of total 90) Congress: 47, BJP: 19, Shiv Sena: 12, Others: 10, SP: 2, NCP: 0 Counting for elections held in three municipal corporation in Maharashtra – Panvel, Bhiwandi and Malegaon – concluded today, voting for which took place on 24 May. The three parts saw a voter turnout of 55, 53 and 60 percent respectively. The elections are significant because the BJP tried to make inroads into the Muslim-majority areas of Malegaon and Bhiwandi, from where it fielded not only a record number of candidates, but also a record number of Muslim candidates. The aim was to snub the Shiv Sena, which has been threatening to exit its alliance with the BJP, which had brought them to power in the 2014 Assembly elections. However, BJP suffered a humiliating defeat in both areas, where the Congress party emerged as the winner. @BJP4India wins #Hindu dominated Panvel, loses #Muslim dominated Malegaon, Bhiwandi. It can't win Muslims unless all candidates are Hindu. — Kiran D Tare (@kirantare) May 26, 2017 This was also the first time civic body elections were being held in Panvel after its civic body was upgraded to a municipal corporation last year, where the BJP emerged as the single largest party. (Graphic: The Quint ) Malegaon is a heavily Muslim-dominated city in Nashik district. Since 2012, its municipal corporation has been run by NCP. It is listed as a ‘sensitive’ city within Maharashtra, prone to communal strife. It has witnessed two bomb blasts in 2006 and 2008. In an outreach move, BJP fielded 27 Muslim candidates this time in Malegaon, where the party did not win a single seat five years ago. Despite surprising victories in Pune, Amravati and Latur, the BJP won just nine seats, coming in fourth. But it’s still an inroad as their tally has risen from 0 to 9. Congress and NCP-JD(S) are expected to take control of the civic body. Coming in first, Congress was led by its sitting MLA Shaikh Asif and his father and two-time MLS Shaikh Rasheed, who has been named as its mayoral candidate. The NCP-JDS alliance is yet to declare a name. AIMIM’s Malegaon president Abdul Malik contested from two seats and lost in both. (Graphic: The Quint ) Congress is now the new Muslim League in Maharashtra. Biggest party in muslim dominated Bhiwandi and Malegaon. — Mandar Sawant (@MandarSawant184) May 26, 2017 Bhiwandi is considered the logistics hub of Maharashtra and holds great political significance. For the Bhiwandi municipality, 460 candidates contested the elections for 90 seats. Congress emerged as the single largest party, winning 47 seats. “The voters have denied BJP and they have wholeheartedly supported the Congress party,” said Bhiwandi city Congress chief Shoab Guddu to DNA . The corporation has been ruled by a Congress-Shiv Sena post-poll alliance since 2012. The two came on top with a combined 42 seat-victory, while the BJP won only on eight seats last time. This time, the NCP formed an alliance with the Samajwadi Party. BJP launched an aggressive campaign here as well, fielding 18 Muslim candidates. However, like in Malegaon, the saffron party’s efforts were thwarted by Bhiwandi as well. (Graphic: The Quint ) In the 78-seat Municipal Corporation of the Hindu-dominated area, the contest was primarily between Shiv Sena, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Peasants and Workers’ Party (PWP) allied with Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). In a landslide victory, BJP came out on top, emerging as the single largest party. A key reason for the BJP’s win in Panvel was the effective selling of the development of Navi Mumbai International Airport and Jawaharlal Nehru Port to Panvel voters. But ‘development’ did not sell with voters of Malegaon and Bhiwandi. BJP contested the elections in alliance with RPI(A) and PRP. Congress fought alongside its allies PWP and NCP. Shiv Sena contested the elections alone. Download TheQuint App About Us Advertise With Us Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Powered by Quintype 2017 © Copyright TheQuint "

BJP Looks at Naidu – the Troubleshooter! BJP never cared for TDP or Chandrababu Naidu after that historic mandate in 2014 elections but wants to use his experience when they needed. BJP is in need of Naidu’s services ahead of the Presidential Elections in July. Amit Shah who met Chandrababu Naidu the other day in Vijayawada asked him to hold talks with his West Bengal Counterpart and Trinamool Congress Supremo Mamata Banerjee for her support in the election. BJP and Mamata are at loggerheads in the recent years as the saffron party is keen to expand its base in West Bengal. On the other side, Congress is reaching out to all the Opposition Parties to put up a common candidate against NDA candidate. BJP is not keen on going for election in this prestigious election and is trying its level best for the election to be unanimous. Naidu previously has the experience of working as NDA Convener and is a good friend of Senior Leaders of Various Parties in the Country. The tenure of President Pranab Mukherjee ends on July 24th. NDA is also yet to announce its candidate for the election. Naidu will be very soon flying to Kolkata to sit with Mamata. Naidu’s Office already reached out to West Bengal CMO for an Appointment.

Can I connect the drain to A? Yes. If you look in the sandwich section you will see that we offer many such packages. When you are pressurizing B, A is connected to tank, allowing the reducer to do its job. When you reverse, the drain or tank port of the reducer is pressurized by A. This increases the setting of the reducer and helps keep the reducer open in the reverse flow direction. Why does Sun profile the ends of your sandwich manifolds? Is there a functional reason? In the beginning, the bosses (profiles) were cylindrical and centered on the cavity. The boss created a consistant locating spot for the fixture that put in the bolt through holes. The first step in machining sandwiches was to put in the cavities and this was done using big old #4 Warner-Swazey turret lathes. Adding the circular boss was practically free at this point. When 2 or more sandwiches are stacked they look designed rather than a random stack of blocks. This was deemed esthetically pleasing and became a Sun trademark. You can spot Sun sandwiches from across a factory floor. We switched to CNC in the early 80's but kept the circular boss. At this time the first sandwich with 2 cavities on one side was designed, the YFCG XHN AA. Obviously we could not use a circular boss centered on a cavity; we tried a partial circular boss centered on both of the cavities, but the resulting appearance was poor. The solution was a rectangular boss with radiused corners. The resulting profile was pleasing and more modern looking than the circular boss and served a functional purpose--less material had to be removed. We changed all the other sandwich bosses to match. We have applied the boss profile to some custom manifolds.....just because it looks good. How big is a drop of hydraulic oil? There are exactly 250 Sun drops in a cubic inch or 15 in a cc. How can I assemble a stack of sandwiches and keep it dry? Make sure the surfaces are flat and that there are no burrs. Do not polish the surface; machining marks are good. The machining marks help stop the o-rings from acting as pumps. Look for dings on the corners of seal plates that will create gaps. Stud rods or cap screws must not bottom out in the sub-plate. It is very important to assemble a stack of sandwich valves keeping the o-ring sealing surfaces “dry.” The hydrostatic properties of an oil film under the o-rings, and at the seal plate interface, can create a fluid path leading from the pressurized port interfaces to the outside edge of the stack. (Under this condition, as noted in bullet point above, an o-ring can actually act as a “pump.”) So, if you start with a wet seal interface in your stack, there’s a good chance it will always stay wet. Why doesn't Sun anodize their aluminum bodies? Reasons to anodize: To increase corrosion resistance. Sun uses 6061-T651 aluminum. It is one of the most corrosion resistant aluminum alloys there is. Whether or not anodizing improves the corrosion resistance of 6061 aluminum is debatable. We have yet to have a manifold returned because of corrosion. Appearance (color). The 2 colors that would appeal to Sun would be blue or black. Unfortunately these are the colors that are hardest to do consistently. To provide a hard wear surface. Sun does not make parts-in-body valves. The manifold is just plumbing. We don't need a wear surface. Because everyone else does it. Bad reason. Reasons to not anodize: Cost. It's another process. Logistics. When you make tens of thousands of manifolds a month and you anodize hundreds, it's a problem. Consistency. See above. Stamping. After a body is anodized you cannot do any more stamping without making a mess. Inspection. Have you ever tried to look for burrs in a black anodized body? It's the old blackboard factory at night scenario. Torque. You will experience an increase in breakaway torque when removing items from an anodized manifold. Fatigue life. This is the best reason to not anodize. Fatigue failure is a very complex phenomenon. What it takes to initiate a crack is difficult to predict. What it takes to propagate a crack is readily defined. Anodizing produces a very thin, very hard, and very brittle surface on aluminum. The first time you pressurize an anodized aluminum manifold you have initiated fatigue cracks. Whether or not the stress is enough to propagate the cracks is a matter of pressure and manifold geometry. Anodizing an aluminum manifold grossly reduces the fatigue life by anywhere from 20% to 50%.

This installation requires a retainer and seal kit which are purchased separately. See ""Related Accessories"" section. Important: Carefully consider the maximum system pressure. The pressure rating of the manifold is dependent on the manifold material, with the port type/size a secondary consideration. Manifolds constructed of aluminum are not rated for pressures higher than 3000 psi (210 bar), regardless of the port type/size specified.

Technology changed how the recent Indian election campaigns were conducted - showing how mainstream it has become even for managing campaigns in rural areas. Article: With the euphoria of the BJP’s massive victory and Narendra Modi’s swearing in as 15th prime minister now almost over, and the media dissecting all possible data to near death, I decided to dig deep and find out how BJP actually outdid the grand old Congress in all aspects. Was Jairam Ramesh actually right when he said that BJP had out-funded the Congress? Can increase in campaign spend transfer into such a large scale mandate or was there more to it? Perhaps, Jairam himself had realised the flaw in his earlier comment and rectified the same in an interview with a national daily. Admitting that the BJP had rewritten the rules of the game he said: “The party (Congress) has to be proactive in communication, has to have vastly improved systems of feedback, and be adept at gauging the public sentiment and mood.” Bang on!

Banerjee | Updated: May 26, 2017 12:13 am It is therefore probably no accident that Modi is the first Prime Minister of India after Mrs Gandhi to clearly try to project a vision of the India he wants. (Illustration by-Subrata Dhar) I miss the old RSS. I never liked their views, but I appreciated the sophistication of their position. When I first arrived in the United States, I would try to explain to my new friends the fact that the RSS did not want Muslims to convert since they were already, in effect, Hindus who practiced Islam. All they wanted, my RSS friends would tell me, was that the Muslims accepted that there was no escape. I understood why many Muslims found this offensive or worse, but it did stand in interesting contrast with the naked proselytising zeal that Christians and Mormons in Ronald Reagan ’s America were awash with. “Don’t you want to be saved?” was often the opening gambit. “We have ways to discuss religion that do not descend to this level”, I would try to imply to them. I am not sure they understood. In my youth, the typical RSS representative I met was an intellectual; they quoted the Quran at me and I, who had not read it, could not respond. Much like the Communists, for the aspiring intellectuals among us, they provided a forum where one could discuss ideas and aspirations that went beyond the merely mundane; again, like the Communists, they tended to be generous with their support, psychological, pedagogical and economic. I was one of the privileged, and could afford to disdain what both sides had to offer, but I did appreciate what they were trying. I have no idea whether this is actually how it happened in his specific case, but I can see exactly how a clever and intellectually voracious young man from a disadvantaged background, like Narendra Modi , could have ended up as a swayamsevak. It is therefore probably no accident that Modi is the first Prime Minister of India after Mrs Gandhi to clearly try to project a vision of the India he wants. It is not a vision I like — Modi’s India is strong, modern and developed but not open, liberal or moral — but I appreciate his effort to inspire us to think beyond ourselves after the decade of silence with Manmohan Singh . Indeed, it is part of Modi’s political genius that he figured out that the average Indian is actually happy to make sacrifices for the nation and values being asked. That is why demonetisation, despite being entirely ill-conceived as a policy, remains popular — people appreciate the ambition behind the project, the desire for a cleaner India at the cost of some short-run pain, even if the implementation was lacking. What worries me is that Modi is the only one among those who wield power in the BJP today who is still a chip off that old RSS block. The rest are either men of action — administrators or party men — or straightforward thugs. The historian Ram Guha made the point to me that in the previous NDA government, almost all the top ministers were very well-read and had written books — think of Atal Bihari Vajpayee , L.K. Advani, Jaswant Singh or Arun Shourie — which is obviously not the case now. This matters for two reasons. First, being a part of intellectual debates affects the decision-maker’s ability to engage with and learn from those whom they disagree with. Jagat Mehta, Nehru’s one-time private secretary and an ardent Nehruvian, was foreign secretary when Vajpayee was foreign minister in the Janata Party government in the late 1970s. Between them, they crafted our most successful engagement with Pakistan in the post-Independence era, largely because they could talk to each other with mutual respect across the political divide that separated them. The fact that a man as brilliant and committed as Raghuram Rajan could be sacrificed for political exigencies suggests to me that we no longer live in that same world. Second, and perhaps more importantly, it changes the nature of the political engagement with delicate issues like religion. In the old RSS, religion was not about individuals — they often had Muslim or Christian partners or wives (I am afraid they were all upper caste men; that has not changed very much). It was a way of thinking about the world. That distinction is crucial in politics because it changes the nature of the conflict. Once it is about whether I have the right to beat you up because you ate or sold beef, rather than about whether there should be a debate about what Indian-ness constitutes and whether it should proscribe the consumption of beef, I am afraid we are lost. Living in America, I am often confronted with the analogy between Modi and Donald Trump. Both are men who make a virtue of being strong and have generally right-wing views — but the similarity ends there. Modi has enormous forbearance and discipline about things he cares for, both of which the American president could definitely do with. Modi, when he does open his mouth, usually appeals to our highest sentiment, whereas Trump trumpets his basest instincts. My problem with Modi is that he stays silent so often as to allow the worst of his party to drive the agenda. This may be strategic, but it is a dangerous game to play. The Republican Party in the United States is now paying the price of a two-faced approach, where the top leaders of the party would talk about shared American values, but allow a coalition of racists, misogynists and people obsessed with not paying taxes to set the actual agenda. At some point, that coalition decided there was no reason to keep up the façade any more — hence, Donald Trump. Something similar could happen to the BJP. Sooner or later, someone in the BJP who is much more openly hostile to the minorities will realise that they could be a more credible standard-bearer for the extreme right than Modi; if the party continues to indulge that wing rather than reining them in, they might have the legitimacy to take on Modi and win. It is time we start paying attention to what is happening within the right. And maybe Modi should as well. The writer teaches economics at MIT and co-created MIT’s Micromasters in Data and Economics for Development Policy For all the latest India News , download Indian Express App now Tags: BJP Narendra Modi RSS S Srikanth May 27, 2017 at 11:53 am The problem with Indians living in the US and commenting about India is that they know very less of India .. no doubt they are intellectuals but they lack that Indian flavour .. Raghuram Rajan would make a better fed governor than an RBI governor .. am not going to comment more on this article.. just one thing .. India today needs doers more than thinkers .. not that thinkers are not important .. of course they are .. but for over 60 years we have been only thinking and doing less .. we need someone like Modi and Amit shah today .. actually all we want is another ten years of this rule in India .. after that we don't care who is in power .. cos whoever it is , they have to follow the process that is being set today .. by then many things in India would become irreversible .. it's not the party which matters to us ., it's the actions .. so please sip your Starbucks coffee and chill on the Miami beach side with your Long Island .. just leave India to these people for a few more years .. Reply A Arshad Islam May 27, 2017 at 10:54 am The author thinks Modi does not support the oppressive and communal policies of the bjp. I think he strongly supports it. The only reason he does not openly support it is not to rattle the illusion of voters who support for the promise of economic development. Reply R Ram May 26, 2017 at 11:14 pm To all anti-Hindu 'intolarance' brigade like this author, that young muslim lady who married to a stani begged to come back to India ruled by 'Hindu fanatics' tells all! She nailed your lies and almost slapped all pseudo-secular anti-national left brigade of propa ists! Hoe many muslims moved over to pak/Bangladesh? Reality is crores of Bangla muslims sneak inside India illegally, even Rohingas want to do that. And same time every Hindu/Sikh from stan refuses to go back to that wretched life reserved for minorities there. Does it say something about reality, notwithstanding all your cacophony of intolerance by Hindu nationalists? Reply M Member intolerance brigade May 27, 2017 at 11:08 am Agree that India still much better place than ""stan"" though the right wing is trying hard to make this a Hindu stan. Reply K kvjayan May 26, 2017 at 11:02 pm The author writes: ""The fact that a man as brilliant and committed as Raghuram Rajan could be sacrificed for political exigencies..."". The 3-year term of this Rajan was over and he went back to his academic job in the US. Reply R Ram May 26, 2017 at 11:02 pm The propa a of 'intolerance' using three stray incidents in a nation of 1.3Billion enslaved for last 1000 years is going on! These left 'liberal' croks never ever mention murder, kil;l and ault culture of leftists when they have power and clout as in WB/Kerala of almost elminating their opposition and ideological compe ors. Or utter dishonesty of pseudo-intellectuals of left parasites embedded in JNU/AMU/HCU/JU etc. mostly in unproductive social sciences departments, that any idea others then their cocoon of thoughts is not worth debating, and tar all such people even a Harvard economist/professor Dr. SubramanSwamy or Nobel Laureate Naipaul as rightwing fanatics, but never intellectuals. and many great nationalistic writers/poets of 'sahitya academy' 'gnayna peeth academy' standing like Dr. Bhairappa of Kannada are deliberately negleted/sidelined and when new administration of nationalists give them their due respect like making them national professor etc. they are decried! Reply J jai May 26, 2017 at 9:53 pm Secularists like this author keep on creating false dichotomy - soft 'old' RSS vs aggressive 'new' RSS, soft Atal vs aggressive Modi, soft Modi vs. aggressive Yogi etc. The fact is that they cannot tolerate the rise of proud, ertive Hindu society. They rather prefer a meek, docile Hinduism that can be trampled upon while perfunctorily praising it for its 'tolerance'. Reply S sochee May 26, 2017 at 9:35 pm Narendra Modi refused to listen to Nehruvian counsel of another Panditji,. Vajpayee and to condemn them to doom.So in the consciousness of Hindus Modi became the yardstick against which other brahminical leaders faded. Still Modi would not be in this position so soon but for the indiscretion committed by Advani by hai Jinnah as a secular epitome at the instance of a fellow traveller Sudhindra Kulkarni. Inspite of immensely deserving it Advani threw away his chance to become leader of Hindus and subsequently the PM. It defies one's imagination why Advani depended so much on a shady character like Kulkarni. That in my opinion is the making of Narendra Modi and he can never be a open liberal and what not, if he really wants to lead us Hindus. Remember even Lord Krishna had to be born in a so called disadvantaged clan the founder of which was cast out by king Yajati. HE was not born to Brahmin parents.Otherwise he would have also messed up. Reply S sochee May 26, 2017 at 9:04 pm I could not understand many of the arguments put forth by this MIT professor.He himself admits that he came in contact with many RSS workers who were intellectually inclined but he is surprised to see Modi who according to the author is intellectually voracious, clever young man belonging to disadvantaged section in their company. Do all those people in RSS belong to privileged section? What about Uma Bharati? Narendra Modi could become Prime Minister because RSS did not invest in stolid Brahmanism unlike ""Pandit"" Nehru. Advani did not send his daughter to become Chief Minister of Gujarat.He sought out Narendra Modi as he had proved his mettle during Ram mandir agitation. That was the m movement for awakening of Hindu consciousness for a life with dignity in their own land crushed under Nehruvian regime which was open liberal and moral so to say. Then as was the won't in liberal,open and moral Nehruvian India horrors of Godhra happened. But this time the response was different. Reply S Sudarshan Nityananda May 26, 2017 at 8:02 pm He is perceptive when he says that Modi is surrounded by either mediocre party hackers or thugs. Reply S Seshubabu Kilambi May 26, 2017 at 7:48 pm The shadow is more opaque and dark. It may have negative impact on the future of party Reply Y yousef May 26, 2017 at 7:34 pm Vanarjeeda, the proof of openness, liberalism is that you are able to write this in a National daily. I would not worry much about your word moral because your academic circles have proven that there are no objective morals. Reply S Smart May 26, 2017 at 7:23 pm Here comes another pathetic sickular, talking bul l like Amartya. Arun Shourie has kept aside a huge fund to bribe people like this author to write anything that spreads hate against Mr. Modi and RSS. People don't really care what you write as they know the ground reality. Reply K Khemu May 26, 2017 at 11:49 pm You are dumb. Bannerjee is another Modi-bhakt like most NRIs. Read the article again and you would realise that he considers Modi as the God-send for India. Reply N Narpatsinh May 26, 2017 at 6:40 pm IE is totally a Modi hatter paper. They collected the guys, who are most critical to Modi and publish their Modi hatter writings. They collecting writers from a group of pseudo seculars, leftists, anti- India Activists. IE is loosing her credibility drastically and Indians are loosing faith of her journalism. Reply C Casteless May 26, 2017 at 5:28 pm IE is full of such ic articles. I am convinced that these columnists pay IE to accept their articles. IE is obviously stands for Indecent Express. It is a third rate journal which is an adda of seculars and commies and Hindu haters Reply H Hemant Kumar May 26, 2017 at 5:17 pm Mr. Modi is better PM than Mr. Vajpayee. This writer belongs to TMC (Trinamul) Camp and is afraid of decimation of TMC and impending capture of Bengal by resurgent BJP. This writer is moulded in Nehruvian mould, an endangered species in near future when victory flag of BJP/ RSS will flutter atop writers' building. Reply A ak dev May 26, 2017 at 3:36 pm This guy is a perfect pseudo who knows how to abuse with a sugared tongue. He makes far reaching conclusions based on information churned by his types who sits is US and talks about the dusty roads in India. Reply V Vijay V May 26, 2017 at 3:35 pm Thought provoking article. Modiji used Advani and the party he had build to come to power, and then he ditched him. If the party continues the worst-of-the-party politics, same may happen to Modiji also. Yogi Adityanath seems to be on track of doing it. Reply A ak dev May 26, 2017 at 3:47 pm There is not need to worry. BJP is better after Modi leading it. BJP will be even further better if some one better than Modi replaces him in BJP. You must know that BJP is a live democracy where only the best will lead unlike the Congress who has to drag itself with Pappu like leaders. Reply K Khemu May 26, 2017 at 11:51 pm Everybody calls it Modi Sarkar not BJP Sakar. It is Modiji all the way. BJP is a big zero without him. S surendra s May 26, 2017 at 3:16 pm Very well written. Let's expect more of him often on these pages. Reply R Ram May 26, 2017 at 11:07 pm That all depends on how much funds ISI can pour in IE! Reply K Khemu May 26, 2017 at 11:52 pm Oh! That is how Arnab is financed? S S. Gowrishankar, May 26, 2017 at 3:00 pm This author relies upon Ram Guha. My God! Alas could someone help this author to wake up? Of all the people this author found Ram Guha to quote? Ram Guha writes garbage and it becomes history and he becomes a historian? Great. My dear friend, like you have written now someone else through the history will someday write that ""gone are those days when people like Modi, Shah, Jaitley etc were presiding over governance, they were well read, knowledgeable, experienced, wish we had somebody like them now"" bla bla. This is a time tested articulation which is common. Guha is a desperado. When he talks, what comes out is worth to be confined to the dust bin. When he writes that paper becomes garbage. And the purported history he creates make him dustorian not historian. And when you rely upon dustorians, you tend to get yourself amalgamated into the same environment. BEST OF LUCK to you. Reply G Govinda May 26, 2017 at 2:10 pm Another Ivory tower article suggesting a successful politician how to do better politics. If I go by media report India is burning with crime against minorities, dalits. People are lynched in name of Gou raksha. Yes, there are some incidents. But statistically they can be ignored. Now coming to the main thread of article. RSS still has intellectuals as members. They still give their opinion on policy. These opinions are considered while taking policy decision. Just because media highlights what they think is important for their agenda it does not mean policy is driven by the fringe. RSS has many who are not intellectuals. But these people will not survive the drill of RSS without having a strong ideology. RSS expanded and it took all category people into the fold. But character of RSS is still same and it should remain. MSM will make us believe all fringe belongs to RSS. That is big lie coming out of ivory tower authors. Reply S sapan May 26, 2017 at 2:00 pm The writer is a perfect example of a left over British slave. Lot of English words without really any substance to them. You ingrate, you should be thankful for these so called ""fringes"" else your chances of being converted would be very high seeing your disdain for Hindus.

23," WHY THE OWAISI BROTHERS CAN ONLY HELP THE BJP Sunday, May 28, 2017 FRONT PAGE POLITICS BORDER OPINION SOUTH ASIA WORLD GENDER YOUNG CITIZEN LIFE WHY THE OWAISI BROTHERS CAN ONLY HELP THE BJP SEEMA MUSTAFA WHY THE OWAISI BROTHERS CAN ONLY HELP THE BJP SEEMA MUSTAFA Tuesday, January 06,2015 NEW DELHI: Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi has suddenly been catapulted centre stage after spending several years limited to his Lok Sabha constituency Hyderabad and occasional forays on Indian television. It is perhaps not a coincidence that his and his brother Akbaruddin’s political rise coincides with that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the national level. Is it that they are saying what the Muslims want to hear and have emerged as these brave warriors taking on the Hindu right wing groups? Or is that they are being supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh for rhetoric that can only polarise and consolidate respective vote banks? These questions have been raised ever since the MIM rise mid-last year and noticed in Maharashtra first where the two brothers addressed large public meetings and actually emerged triumphant from the recent Assembly elections with a couple of seats in the state. The MIM won Aurangabad Central and Byculla seat in Mumbai defeating Shiv Sena and BJP nominees respectively. The two brothers dared what most political parties were hesitant to do at the time, and confronted PM Modi directly. The speeches were bold and brave, and led to considerable debate amongst journalists at the time as to why the response to the MIM leaders from the Shiv Sena and the BJP was not as sharp as expected. And how, when the smallest Facebook post unleashed the most virulent of right wing attacks, the campaign by the Owaisi brothers barely attracted a murmur from the political parties they were ostensibly taking on. Nationalist Congress party chief Sharad Pawar said as much, and was strongly criticised by Asaduddin Owaisi. After Maharashtra the MIM has decided to build a base in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, two states with a significant Muslim population that is currently backing the local regional parties against the BJP. MIM presence through an aggressive Owaisi campaign could divide the Muslim vote to the advantage of the BJP in these two states. However, while the questions of a MIM-BJP understanding do not have confirmed answers organisations like the MIM will clearly only help the BJP consolidate its vote bank.MIM speaks on a strictly Muslim platform, directing its comments for right wing minority consumption. And presents itself as a counter within a religious and not secular political paradigm, very much in the manner in which the BJP and its affiliates work. The RSS announced the ghar wapsi program that earned it considerable flak from both within and outside the country. It was roundly criticised by all communities until now with Owaisi’s remarks stating that all Indians are Muslims and hence ghar wapsi can only be in that direction. These remarks have made the headlines, and let the RSS off the hook with Owaisi’s subsequent ‘clarification’ keeping the discourse well within the realm of religion and not the Indian constitution, “this is my belief. Remember, Islam denounces the use of force. Unlike Sangh Parivar outfits, which say that India will be 100 per cent Hindu by 2021 or Muslims are not nationalists and are stolen property, I am not threatening, coercing or offering people money."" Owaisi’s language is strong and direct, and hence is finding a new audience amongst sections of the Muslims, currently fearful and in some parts actively terrorised. It derives its legitimacy entirely from the religion and as his brother Akbaruddin said in one of his public meetings , “for those who say what one man in Parliament can do, remember Allah is also one.” Theirs is a clever mix of the Constitution, the law and an open appeal to the Muslims as a Muslim vote. Speaking of the BJP Akbaruddin said at a meeting, “whenever they open their mouths they spew venom against Muslims---this BJP that was nothing before now is here in majority...what else has the BJP done?” My question to those who voted for Modi is ...is he a historian, socialist, economist, he could not even speak Mahatma Gandhi’s name, he killed the poor Muslims in Gujarat, that is how he came to power.” There is nothing that is not said by the Owaisi brothers, both powerful orators, both bold and courageous, but both addressing just the Muslims and slowly but gradually creating a platform based on religiosity. This is dangerous politics that will weaken secularism as it joins the efforts of the right wing Hindutva brigade in legitimising the mix of religion and politics in both communities. Besides, the sharp rhetoric being used by both right wing groups feeds into the other, and sharpens the responses and the subsequent polarisation that is not healthy for a secular democracy. The creation of a Muslim fundamentalist platform can only be disastrous at this stage, and interestingly several Muslims have started questioning the intent and the politics of the MIM. In fact the question: are the Owaisi’s working with the BJP, is now being asked by Muslim intellectuals with a senior academic insisting that the rise of the MIM along with the rise of the BJP must not be dismissed as a coincidence.

Of late, he has been siding with BJP's ideology on several issues. Kumar Shakti Shekhar | Posted by Ashna Kumar Kumar.ShaktiShekhar@intoday.com May 27, 2017 | UPDATED 22:42 IST A + A - Highlights 1 In the last inning of his political career, Amarinder Singh is playing on front foot. 2 The position he has been taking on most of the issues are in line with that of BJP. 3 He seems to be a transformed Congress leader ever since he was sworn in as Punjab CM. In the last inning of his political career, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh is playing on the front foot. Of late, the position he has been taking on most of the issues are in line with that of BJP. If his views are not against his Congress party's stand, they are not in unison either. He seems to be a transformed Congress leader ever since he was sworn in as Punjab CM on March 16. Has Amarinder Singh got 'Modified'? Or, is he his usual self? Much before the February Assembly elections in Punjab, Amarinder Singh had declared that he was contesting the last time. He had also sought a chance from the Congress high command to lead the party in the Assembly polls on the same ground. The 'Maharaja of Patiala' was granted whatever he wished for and he went on to lead Congress to a decisive victory. BADALS AND KEJRIWAL ON TARGET TILL PUNJAB POLLS Till elections, Amarinder Singh's statements and tweets were largely related to campaigning. He never named BJP in any tweet though he targeted the other two rivals - the Badals led Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Arvind Kejriwal led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Amarinder Singh made personal comments on the Badals and Kejriwal. His attack on the Badals pertained mainly to law and order, corruption charges and drug menace. However, the former Army Captain's assault on the Delhi Chief Minister was frontal and highly damaging. His comments would, of course, be retorts to provocations by Kejriwal. If you are so sure, why don't you come and fight me? You sneaky little fellow! @ArvindKejriwal https://t.co/h6byJRahSm - Capt.Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) January 12, 2017 SOFT TOWARDS PM MODI AND BJP But never in his campaign the 'Maharaja' ever target Prime Minister Narendra Modi . This was in contrast to not just other Opposition parties but also other Congress leaders, including party vice president Rahul Gandhi . These may lead one to believe that Captain Amarinder Singh may be soft towards BJP and PM Modi. There were reports too claiming that he was about to join BJP in September 2015. However, the Punjab CM refuted this. In a tweet on May 17, he said he never thought of joining BJP due to differences with Congress. In a significant revelation, he said he only toyed with forming own party. Amarinder Singh as a young boy at YPS Stadium, Patiala. Photo: @capt_amarinder Disclosing plans of breaking away from parent Congress and forming a new party in itself is quite a bold statement to make. No other Congress leader can muster enough courage to make such a statement. But Captain Amarinder Singh, saddled firmly in his position, has been speaking his mind, unmindful even of diverting from his Congress party's stand or ideology. The steps or the stand he has been taking appear closer to rival BJP. DOING AWAY WITH VIP CULTURE The Modi government banned red beacons atop vehicles of ministers, politicians and government officials. The announcement was made on April 19. However, similar decision had already been taken by the Punjab government on March 18, just two days after the Amarinder government was sworn in. In fact, the decision to rid Punjab of VIP culture was taken in the new state cabinet's first meeting. All beacon lights were ordered to be removed from vehicles of ministers, MLAs and bureaucrats. On April 21, the Punjab CM surrendered 400 security personnel and the government withdrew 1500 from other protectees. It plans to cut down more to free more security personnel for policing. THE TURNING POINT Captain Amarinder Singh has launched an offensive akin to any 'nationalist' BJP leader ever since Naib Subedar Paramjeet Singh was martyred and his body mutilated by Pakistani forces in Kashmir on May 1. He met the family of the martyr and announced jobs for the latter's children. On his own, he announced that a police job was waiting for martyr Paramjeet Singh's daughter when she completes education and another job was reserved for the son. Later, he heartily accepted the request of the family for naib tehsildar's job to the martyr's daughter and ASI for the son. Meeting with the family of Shaheed JCO Paramjeet Singh today at Veinpoin village was a heart-wrenching experience. pic.twitter.com/dc9Y32fohJ - Capt.Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) May 7, 2017 Being a former Army officer, who had fought the 1965 Pakistan War, Captain Amarinder Singh is clearly passionate about issues related to the military. However, not all ex-servicemen match his zeal. Paid homage to martyrs at State War Memorial Amritsar. Salute the brave hearts who laid their lives for the country! pic.twitter.com/L3dLHvb5h9 - Capt.Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) May 7, 2017 Visited Jallianwala Bagh today. Salute the courage of the freedom fighters who laid down their lives for the Nation. pic.twitter.com/EVDCxtxtto - Capt.Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) May 8, 2017 He also expressed shock at the ghastly kidnapping and murder of Army officer Ummer Fayaz. He exhorted the Centre to take tough action to put an end to such brutality. Really shocked & saddened at cowardly kidnapping & killing of army officer Ummer Fayaz. Need tough action to put an end to such brutality. - Capt.Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) May 10, 2017 The Punjab CM's stand on Major Leetul Gogoi, who had tied a stonepelter as a human shield on the bonnet of a jeep in Kashmir to save election and security personnel from a huge violent crowd, was also in variance with that of Congress for several days. Amarinder Singh had expressed his happiness over Major Gogoi being given clean chit by the Army's Court of Inquiry as early as May 15. Congress took a week more to make its stand clear and second the Punjab CM. Good to hear of @adgpi Court of Inquiry clean chit to 'human shield' officer Major Nitin Gogoi, should be given distinguished service award. - Capt.Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) May 15, 2017 He also said that had he been a young army major, he would have done the same what Major Gogoi did. He is of the view that the Army cannot fight terror with one hand tied behind. Captain Amarinder Singh has also supported the Centre whole-heartedly unlike other Opposition leaders. For instance, he congratulated External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj for ensuring the safe return of Uzma from Pakistan on May 25. Really happy to know of Uzma's safe return to Delhi, congrats to central govt for handling sensitive matter with maturity @SushmaSwaraj - Capt.Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) May 25, 2017 What would please the BJP leaders is the Sikh leader's penchant for Hindu gods and goddesses. Visited the historic Durgiana Mandir in Amritsar to seek blessings of Maa Durga for Punjab and its people. pic.twitter.com/bH2JWXzFFh - Capt.Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) May 8, 2017 Captain Amarinder Singh may have endeared himself to the 'nationalists' and the Sangh Parivar by his deeds and words. However, they may also have reasons to believe that the Punjab CM may be hijacking their agenda and ideology.

BJP ) is one of the two major political parties in India , along with the Indian National Congress . [13] As of 2016 [update] , it is the country's largest political party in terms of representation in the national parliament and state assemblies, and it is the world's largest party in terms of primary membership. The BJP is a right-wing party, [6] [14] with close ideological and organisational links to the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh . The BJP's origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh , formed in 1951 by Syama Prasad Mookerjee . After the State of Emergency in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party ; it defeated the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election . After three years in power, the Janata party dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP. Although initially unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the 1984 general election , it grew in strength on the back of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its government lasted only 13 days. After the 1998 general election , the BJP-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) formed a government under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for a year. Following fresh elections, the NDA government, again headed by Vajpayee, lasted for a full term in office; this was the first non-Congress government to do so. In the 2004 general election , the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat, and for the next ten years the BJP was the principal opposition party. Long time Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi led it to a landslide victory in the 2014 general election . Since that election, Modi leads the NDA government as Prime Minister and as of March 2017 [update] , the alliance governs 17 states. The official ideology of the BJP is "" integral humanism "", first formulated by Deendayal Upadhyaya in 1965. The party expresses a commitment to Hindutva , and its policy has historically reflected Hindu nationalist positions. The BJP advocates social conservatism and a foreign policy centred on nationalist principles. Its key issues have included the abrogation of the special status to Jammu and Kashmir , the building of a Ram temple in Ayodhya and the implementation of a uniform civil code . However, the 1998–2004 NDA government did not pursue any of these controversial issues. It instead focused on a largely neoliberal economic policy prioritising globalisation and economic growth over social welfare .

It was founded in collaboration with the Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and was widely regarded as the political arm of the RSS. [15] The Jana Sangh's aims included the protection of India's ""Hindu"" cultural identity, in addition to countering what it perceived to be the appeasement of Muslim people and the country of Pakistan by the Congress party and then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru . The RSS loaned several of its leading pracharaks , or full-time workers, to the Jana Sangh to get the new party off the ground. Prominent among these was Deendayal Upadhyaya , who was appointed General Secretary. The Jana Sangh won only three Lok Sabha seats in the first general elections in 1952 . It maintained a minor presence in parliament until 1967. [16] [17] The Jana Sangh's first major campaign, begun in early 1953, centred on a demand for the complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India. [18] Mookerjee was arrested in May 1953 for violating orders from the state government restraining him from entering Kashmir. He died of a heart attack the following month, while still in jail. [18] Mauli Chandra Sharma was elected to succeed Mookerjee; however, he was forced out of power by the RSS activists within the party, and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS. The party minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of integral humanism , which formed the official doctrine of the party. [19] Younger leaders, such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani also became involved with the leadership in this period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were legislating a uniform civil code , banning cow slaughter and abolishing the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir . [20] After assembly elections across the country in 1967, the party entered into a coalition with several other parties, including the Swatantra Party and the socialists. It formed governments in various states across the Hindi heartland , including Madhya Pradesh , Bihar and Uttar Pradesh . It was the first time the Jana Sangh held political office, albeit within a coalition; this caused the shelving of the Jana Sangh's more radical agenda. [21] Janata Party (1977–80) Main article: Janata Party In 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a state of emergency . The Jana Sangh took part in the widespread protests, with thousands of its members being imprisoned along with other agitators across the country. In 1977, the emergency was withdrawn and general elections were held. The Jana Sangh merged with parties from across the political spectrum, including the Socialist Party , the Congress (O) and the Bharatiya Lok Dal to form the Janata Party, with its main agenda being defeating Indira Gandhi. [17] The Janata Party won a majority in 1977 and formed a government with Morarji Desai as Prime Minister. The former Jana Sangh contributed the largest tally to the Janata Party's parliamentary contingent, with 93 seats or 31% of its strength. Vajpayee , previously the leader of the Jana Sangh, was appointed the Minister of External Affairs . [22] The national leadership of the former Jana Sangh consciously renounced its identity, and attempted to integrate with the political culture of the Janata Party, based on Gandhian and Hindu traditionalist principles. According to Christophe Jaffrelot , this proved to be an impossible assimilation. [23] The state and local levels of the Jana Sangh remained relatively unchanged, retaining a strong association with the RSS, which did not sit well with the moderate centre-right constituents of the Party. [24] Violence between Hindus and Muslims increased sharply during the years that the Janata Party formed the government, with former Jana Sangha members being implicated in the riots at Aligarh and Jamshedpur in 1978-79. The other major constituents of the Janata Party demanded that the Jana Sangh should break from the RSS, which the Jana Sangh refused to do. Eventually, a fragment of the Janata Party broke off to form the Janata Party (Secular) . The Morarji Desai government was reduced to a minority in the Parliament, forcing its resignation. Following a brief period of coalition rule, general elections were held in 1980, in which the Janata Party fared poorly, winning only 31 seats. In April 1980, shortly after the elections, the National Executive Council of the Janata Party banned its members from being 'dual members' of party and the RSS. In response, the former Jana Sangh members left to create a new political party, known as the Bharatiya Janata Party. [25] [22] BJP (1980–present) Influential figures Syama Prasad Mookerjee , founder of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh Atal Bihari Vajpayee , the first BJP prime minister (1998–2004) Lal Krishna Advani , deputy Prime Minister under Vajpayee and one of the architects of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement Formation and early days Although the newly formed BJP was technically distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism . [4] This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984 . [4] The assassination of Indira Gandhi a few months earlier resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP. [26] Babri Masjid demolition and the Hindutva movement Further information: Ram Rath Yatra and Demolition of the Babri Masjid The failure of Vajpayee's moderate strategy led to a shift in the ideology of the party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism. [27] [28] In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In the early 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the site of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya . The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1527. There is a dispute about whether a temple once stood there. [29] The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site was the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque. [30] The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election platform. It won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government of V. P. Singh . [31] In September 1990, Advani began a rath yatra (chariot journey) to Ayodhya in support of the Ram temple movement. According to Guha, the imagery employed by the yatra was ""religious, allusive, militant, masculine, and anti-Muslim"", and the speeches delivered by Advani during the yatra accused the government of appeasing Muslims and practising "" pseudo-secularism "" that obstructed the legitimate aspirations of Hindus. [32] Advani defended the yatra, stating that it had been free of incident from Somnath to Ayodhya, and that the English media were to blame for the violence that followed. [33] Advani was placed under preventive detention on the orders of the then Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav . A large number of kar sevaks nonetheless converged on Ayodhya. On the orders of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav , 150,000 of them were detained, yet half as many managed to reach Ayodhya and some attacked the mosque. Three days of fighting with the paramilitary forces ended with the deaths of several kar sevaks . Hindus were urged by VHP to ""take revenge"" for these deaths, resulting in riots against Muslims across Uttar Pradesh. [34] The BJP withdrew its support from the V.P. Singh government, leading to fresh general elections. It once again increased its tally, to 120 seats, and won a majority in the Uttar Pradesh assembly. [35] On 6 December 1992, the RSS and its affiliates organised a rally involving more than 100,000 VHP and BJP activists at the site of the mosque. [35] Under circumstances that are not entirely clear, the rally developed into a frenzied attack that ended with the demolition of the mosque . [35] Over the following weeks, waves of violence between Hindus and Muslims erupted all over the country, killing over 2,000 people. [35] The government briefly banned the VHP, and many BJP leaders, including Advani were arrested for making inflammatory speeches provoking the demolition. [36] [37] Several historians have said that the demolition was the product of a conspiracy by the Sangh Parivar, and not a spontaneous act. [35] A 2009 report , authored by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan , found that 68 people were responsible for the demolition, mostly leaders from the BJP. [37] Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi . The report also criticised Kalyan Singh , Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the demolition. [37] He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the demolition. [37] Anju Gupta, an Indian Police Service officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were a major factor in the mob's behaviour. [38] In the parliamentary elections in 1996, the BJP capitalised on the communal polarisation that followed the demolition to win 161 Lok Sabha seats, making it the largest party in parliament. [39] Vajpayee was sworn in as Prime Minister, but was unable to attain a majority in the Lok Sabha, forcing the government to resign after 13 days. [39] NDA government (1998–2004) Further information: National Democratic Alliance (India) A coalition of regional parties formed the government in 1996, but this grouping was short lived, and mid-term polls were held in 1998. The BJP contested the elections leading a coalition called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which contained its existing allies like the Samata Party , the Shiromani Akali Dal , the Shiv Sena in addition to the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the Biju Janata Dal . Among these regional parties, the Shiv Sena was the only one which had an ideology similar to the BJP; Amartya Sen , for example, called the coalition an ""ad hoc"" grouping. [40] [41] The NDA had a majority with outside support from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Vajpayee returned as Prime Minister. [42] However, the coalition ruptured in May 1999 when the leader of AIADMK, Jayalalitha , withdrew her support, and fresh elections were held again. [43] On 13 October 1999, the NDA, without the AIADMK, won 303 seats in parliament and thus an outright majority. The BJP had its highest ever tally of 183. Vajpayee became Prime Minister for the third time; Advani became Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister . This NDA government lasted its full term of five years. Its policy agenda included a more aggressive stance on defence and terror as well as neo-liberal economic policies. [44] In 2001, Bangaru Laxman , then the BJP president, was filmed accepting a bribe of ? 100,000 (equivalent to ? 280,000 or US$4,300 in 2016) [45] to recommend the purchase of hand-held thermal imagers for the Indian Army to the Defence Ministry, in a sting operation by Tehelka journalists . [46] [47] The BJP was forced to make him resign and he was subsequently prosecuted. In April 2012, he was sentenced to four years in prison. [48] 2002 Gujarat violence Main article: 2002 Gujarat violence On 27 February 2002, a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was burned outside the town of Godhra , killing 59 people. The incident was seen as an attack upon Hindus, and sparked off massive anti-Muslim violence across the state of Gujarat that lasted several weeks. [49] The death toll estimated was as high as 2000, while 150,000 were displaced. [50] Rape, mutilation, and torture were also widespread. [50] [51] The then-Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and several high-ranking government officials were accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as were police officers who allegedly directed the rioters and gave them lists of Muslim-owned properties. [52] In April 2009, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riots cases. In 2012, Modi was cleared of complicity in the violence by the SIT and BJP MLA Maya Kodnani , who later held a cabinet portfolio in the Modi government, was convicted of having orchestrated one of the riots and sentenced to 28 years imprisonment. [53] [54] Scholars such as Paul Brass , Martha Nussbaum and Dipankar Gupta have said that there was a high level of state complicity in the incidents. [55] [56] [57] General election defeats Vajpayee called for elections in early 2004 , six months ahead of schedule. The NDA's campaign was based on the slogan "" India Shining "", which sought to depict it as responsible for a rapid economic transformation of the country. [58] However, the NDA unexpectedly suffered a heavy defeat, winning only a 186 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 222 of the Congress and its allies. Manmohan Singh succeeded Vajpayee as Prime Minister as the head of the United Progressive Alliance . The NDA's failure to reach out to rural Indians was provided as an explanation for its defeat, as was its divisive policy agenda. [58] [59] In May 2008, the BJP won the state elections in Karnataka . This was the first time that the party won assembly elections in any South Indian state . In the 2009 general elections , its strength in the Lok Sabha was reduced to 116 seats. It lost the next assembly election in 2013. [60] General election victory, 2014 Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India , following the 2014 Indian general election . In the 2014 Indian general election , the BJP won 282 seats, leading the NDA to a tally of 336 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha. [61] Narendra Modi was sworn in as the 15th Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014. [62] [63] The vote share of the BJP was 31% of all votes cast, a low figure relative to the number of seats it won. [64] This was the first instance since 1984 of a single party achieving an outright majority in the Indian Parliament [65] and the first time that it achieved a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own strength. Support was concentrated in the Hindi-speaking belt in North-central India. [64] The magnitude of the victory was not predicted by most opinion and exit polls. [64] Political analysts have suggested several reasons for this victory, including the popularity of Modi, and the loss of support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term. [66] The BJP was also able to expand its traditionally upper-caste, upper-class support base and received significant support from middle-class and Dalit people, as well as among Other Backward Classes . [67] [64] Its support among Muslims remained low; only 8% of Muslim voters voted for the BJP. [67] [64] The BJP was also very successful at mobilising its supporters, and raising voter turnout among them. [64] General election results The Bharatiya Janata Party was officially created in 1980, and the first general election it contested was in 1984, in which it won only two Lok Sabha seats. Following the election in 1996, the BJP became the largest party in the Lok Sabha for the first time, but the government it formed was short-lived. [39] In the elections of 1998 and 1999, it remained the largest party, and headed the ruling coalition on both occasions. [44] In the 2014 general election, it won an outright majority in parliament. From 1991 onwards, a BJP member has led the Opposition whenever the party was not in power. [68] Year General election Seats won Change in seats % of votes Vote swing Ref.

[78] [79] It is committed to Hindutva , an ideology articulated by Indian independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar . According to the party, Hindutva is cultural nationalism favouring Indian culture over westernisation , thus it extends to all Indians regardless of religion. [4] However, scholars and political analysts have called their Hindutva ideology an attempt to redefine India and recast it as a Hindu country to the exclusion of other religions, making it a Hindu nationalist party in a general sense. [35] [4] [80] [81] The BJP has slightly moderated its stance after the NDA was formed in 1998, due to the presence of parties with a broader set of ideologies. [35] [44] The BJP's Hindutva ideology has been reflected in many of its government policies. It supports the construction of the Ram temple at the site of the Babri Mosque. [80] This issue was its major poll plank in the 1991 general elections. [80] However, the demolition of the mosque during a BJP rally in 1992 resulted in a backlash against it, leading to a decline of the temple's prominence in its agenda. [80] The education policy of the NDA government reorganised the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and tasked it with extensively revising the textbooks used in Indian schools. [82] Various scholars have stated that this revision, especially in the case of history textbooks, was a covert attempt to "" saffronise "" Indian history. [82] [83] [84] [85] The NDA government introduced Vedic astrology as a subject in college curricula, despite opposition from several leading scientists. [86] Taking a position against what it calls the ""pseudo-secularism"" of the Congress party, the BJP instead supports ""positive secularism"". [80] Vajpayee laid out the BJP's interpretation of Mahatma Gandhi 's doctrine of Sarva Dharma Sambhava and contrasted it with what he called European secularism. [87] He had said that Indian secularism attempted to see all religions with equal respect, while European secularism was independent of religion, thus making the former more ""positive"". [88] The BJP supports a uniform civil code , which would apply a common set of personal laws to every citizen regardless of their personal religion, replacing the existing laws which vary by religious community. According to historian Yogendra Malik, this ignores the differential procedures required to protect the cultural identity of the Muslim minority. [4] [80] The BJP favours the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which grants a greater degree of autonomy to the Jammu and Kashmir in recognition of the unusual circumstances surrounding its accession to the Indian union. [4] The BJP opposes illegal migration into India from Bangladesh. [81] The party states that this migration, mostly in the states of Assam and West Bengal, threatens the security, economy and stability of the country. [81] Academics have pointed out that the BJP refers to Hindu migrants from Bangladesh as refugees, and reserves the term ""illegal"" for Muslim migrants. [81] Academic Michael Gillan writes that this is an attempt to use an emotive issue to mobilise Hindu sentiment in a region where the party has not been historically successful. [81] [89] In 2013, the Supreme Court of India reinstated the controversial Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , which, among other things, criminalises homosexuality. There was a popular outcry, although clerics, including Muslim religious leaders, stated that they supported the verdict. [90] [91] BJP president Rajnath Singh said that the party supported section 377, because it believed that homosexuality was unnatural, [92] though its stand has softened after its victory in the 2014 general elections . [93] Economic policies The BJP's economic policy has changed considerably since its founding. There is a significant range of economic ideologies within the party. In the 1980s, like the Jana Sangh, it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its affiliates. It supported swadeshi (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a protectionist export policy . However, it supported internal economic liberalisation , and opposed the state-driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress. [94] During the 1996 elections, the BJP shifted its stance away from protectionism and towards globalisation ; its election manifesto recommended increasing foreign investment in priority sectors, while restricting it in others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India. [94] This was criticised by the left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch). [94] The communist parties said that the BJP was attempting to appease the World Bank and the United States government through its neoliberal policies. [94] Similarly, the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its swadeshi ideology. [94] The two NDA governments in the period 1998-2004 introduced significant deregulation and privatisation of government owned enterprises. It also introduced tariff-reducing measures. These reforms built off of the initial economic liberalisation introduced by the Congress government in the early 1990s. [95] India's GDP growth increased substantially during the tenure of the NDA. The 2004 campaign slogan ""India Shining"" was based on the party's belief that the free market would bring prosperity to all sectors of society. [96] After its unexpected defeat, commentators said that it was punished for neglecting the needs of the poor and focusing too much on its corporate allies. [58] [59] [97] This shift in the economic policies of the BJP was also visible in state governments, especially in Gujarat, where the BJP held power for 16 years. [98] Modi's government, in power from 2002 to 2014, followed a strongly neo-liberal agenda, presented as a drive towards development. [99] [100] Its policies have included extensive privatisation of infrastructure and services, as well as a significant rollback of labour and environmental regulations. While this was praised by the business community, commentators criticised it as catering to the BJP's upper class constituency instead of the poor. [99] [101] Defence and counterterrorism Compared to the Congress, the BJP takes a more aggressive and nationalistic position on defence policy and terrorism. [102] [103] The Vajpayee-led NDA government carried out nuclear weapons tests, and enacted the Prevention of Terrorism Act , which later came under heavy criticism. [102] [103] It also deployed troops to evict infiltrators from Kargil, and supported the United States' War on Terror . [104] Although previous Congress governments developed the capability for a nuclear weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II , a series of five nuclear tests in 1998. [102] The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range ballistic missile. They were seen as an attempt to display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP. [102] The Vajpayee government ordered the Indian armed forces to expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying Kashmir territory, later known as the Kargil War . [105] [106] Although the government was later criticised for the intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence, it was successful in ousting them from the previously Indian-controlled territory. [105] [106] The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to the US War on Terror, in the hope of better addressing India's issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir. This led to closer defence ties with the US, including negotiations for the sale of weapons. [104] After the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act. [103] The aim of the act was to improve the government's ability to deal with terrorism. [103] It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha ; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a joint session of the Parliament , where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass. [103] The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism. [103] However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties , and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it had been used to target Muslims. [103] It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004. [107] Foreign policy The historical stance of the BJP towards foreign policy, like the Jana Sangh, was based on an aggressive Hindu nationalism combined with economic protectionism. [108] The Jana Sangh was founded with the explicit aim of reversing the partition of India ; as a result, its official position was that the existence of Pakistan was illegitimate. [108] This antagonism toward Pakistan remains a significant influence on the BJP's ideology. [108] [109] The party and its affiliates have strongly opposed India's long standing policy of nonalignment , and instead advocate closeness to the United States . [108] The Vajpayee government's foreign policy in many ways represented a radical shift from BJP orthodoxy, while maintaining some aspects of it. [94] [109] Its policy also represented a significant change from the Nehruvian idealism of previous governments, opting instead for realism. [110] His party criticised him for adopting a much more moderate stance with Pakistan. In 1998, he made a landmark visit to Pakistan, and inaugurated the Delhi–Lahore Bus service. [108] Vajpayee signed the Lahore Declaration , which was an attempt to improve Indo-Pakistani relations that deteriorated after the 1998 nuclear tests. [108] However, the presence of Pakistani soldiers and militants in the disputed Kashmir territory was discovered a few months later, causing the 1999 Kargil War . The war ended a couple of months later, with the expulsion of the infiltrators two months later, without any shift in the Line of Control that marked the de facto border between the two countries. [108] Despite the war, Vajpayee continued to display a willingness to engage Pakistan in dialogue. This was not well received among the BJP cadre, who criticised the government for being ""weak"". [108] This faction of the BJP asserted itself at the post-Kargil Agra summit , preventing any significant deal from being reached. [108] Organisation and structure The BJP is the world's largest political party by primary membership, having 100 million registered members as of April 2015. [1] [111] The organisation of the BJP is strictly hierarchical, with the president being the highest authority in the party. [79] Until 2012, the BJP constitution mandated that any qualified member could be national or state president for a single three-year term. [79] This was amended to a maximum of two consecutive terms. [112] Below the president is the national executive, which contains a variable number of senior leaders from across the country. It is the higher decision making body of the party. Its members are several vice-presidents, general-secretaries, treasurers and secretaries, who work directly with the president. [79] An identical structure, with an executive committee led by a president, exists at the state, regional, district and local level. [79] The BJP is a cadre-based party. It has close connections with other organisations with similar ideology, such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad . The cadres of these groups often supplement the BJP's. Its lower members are largely derived from the RSS and its affiliates, loosely known as the Sangh Parivar : [79] The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( All India Student's Union ), the students' wing of the RSS. [79] The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh ( Indian Farmer's Union ), the farmers' division. [79] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh ( Indian Labourers Union ), the labour union associated with the RSS. [79] The party has subsidiary organisations of its own, such as: The BJP Mahila Morcha ( BJP Women's Front ), its women's division. [79] The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha ( Indian People's Youth Front ), its youth wing. [79] The BJP Minority Morcha ( BJP Minority Front ), its minority division. [79] Presence in various states Current ruling parties in the states and union territories of India BJP Coalition with BJP INC Coalition with INC Other parties As of March 2017 [update] , the BJP has Chief Ministers in thirteen states: Arunachal Pradesh Assam (with Asom Gana Parishad and Bodoland People's Front ) Chhattisgarh Goa (with Goa Forward Party and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party ) Gujarat Haryana Jharkhand Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra (with Shiv Sena ) Manipur (with National People's Party and Naga People's Front ) Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh Uttarakhand In four other states, it shares power with other political parties. In all these states, the BJP is junior ally in the ruling alliance. The states are: Jammu and Kashmir (with Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party ) Nagaland (with Naga People's Front )and Andhra Pradesh (with Telugu Desam Party ) In the past, the BJP has also been the sole party in power in the following states Himachal Pradesh Karnataka Delhi It has been a part of the government in the following states as a junior ally being a part of coalition governments in the past: Odisha (with Biju Janata Dal ) Bihar (with Janata Dal (United) ) Punjab (with Shiromani Akali Dal ) Puducherry (with All India N.R.

36," Unlike UP, NO BAN On Cow Slaughter In Northeast If BJP Comes To Power Next Year - Rajnikant V/s CID Jokes CLOSE Entertainment Just For Fun Facts Videos News Everything Else Coupons About Contact Partner Terms Privacy Policy Entertainment Just For Fun Facts Videos News Everything Else Coupons Unlike UP, NO BAN On Cow Slaughter In Northeast If BJP Comes To Power Next Year News Politics by Priya Gupta - Mar 27, 2017 33.4k SHARES BJP is known to be a party for which cow is not just an animal and protecting it from getting slaughtered is something which every party worker promises of. However, sometimes politics makes you learn how to adjust as per the situation and the same seems to have happened with Bharatiya Janata Party in reference to the three Northeastern states where elections are going to held next year. Source On Monday, BJP has said that cow slaughter will not be banned in these states if party comes to power and this becomes necessary for them to clarify as these are Christian majority states and for Christians, beef is an important food item. Here’s what HT was told by Visasolie Lhoungu, Nagaland BJP chief, “Ban on cow slaughter like the one in UP won’t take effect in Nagaland if our party comes to power next year. The reality here is very different and our central leaders are aware of that.” However, a statement has been issued by David Kharsati, general secretary of BJP’s Meghalaya unit, who has blamed “groups with vested interest” to spread rumors. As per the Daily, Shibun Lyngdoh, Meghalaya BJP chief, said, “Even in UP, action is being taken on slaughter houses operating without proper license. While there would be no ban on cow slaughter, we would like the government to ensure killing and sale of animals is done legally and in a hygienic manner. We are in BJP because of the party’s development agenda. The party’s position is improving and more and more people are joining. Things look bright for next year.” According to Hindustan Times, here’s what JV Hluna, BJP president of Mizoram, said, “There would be no ban on cow slaughter in Mizoram and other states in the region where there is a majority Christian population.” Just to inform, beef is one of the most consumed products of Christian majority in Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram. In the meantime, Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister, stated that merely illegal slaughter houses have been closed in UP and they must be closed, without a doubt. IANS reported Sitharaman saying this, “What is being done in Uttar Pradesh is about illegal slaughter houses. I think even the honourable member would not want illegal slaughter houses to function. The Chief Minister (Adityanath Yogi) has been clear (that) he is talking about illegal slaughter houses. There cannot be a difference of opinion here.” Source Even the Uttar Pradesh govt. maintained that the action had been taken against illegal slaughter houses merely. This is what Siddhartha Nath Singh, Health Minister, said, “We are acting only against illegal abattoirs. Licenced slaughter houses are requested to stick to the norms. The licenced slaughter houses should comply with the norms mentioned in the licence and need not to fear. No orders have been issued to take any action against any shop selling chicken, fish or eggs. They need not to fear.” Singh has instructed officials neither to be over-enthusiastic nor disregard the jurisdiction. As per him, National Green Tribunal laid emphasis on closing illegal abattoirs. “The NGT had in 2015 observed that illegal slaughter houses are a concern for the environment, while insisting on their closure. However, the previous government did not do anything to ensure the closure of these illegal abattoirs.” What is your opinion with regard to this? Share your views in the comments section below.

""This is criminal misuse of taxpayer's money,"" he said. The AAP demands that this ""Rs 2000 crore be recovered from the BJP,"" Sisodia said. He further alleged, ""These are the same states that are shutting down government schools, hospitals and are running out of medicines. They are splurging money when it is not even an anniversary of their own respective government."" ""We will take this up with the committee that has been set up to monitor the AAP government's ad spends, and also take with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India,"" Sisodia said.

While BJP has bagged the newly formed Panvel municipality, Congress has retained Bhiwandi. Malegaon has given a hung verdict with Congress emerging as the single largest party. Essentially BJP will be able to have its mayor in one and non-BJP parties in two municipalities which have high minority population. Panvel Municipal Corporation polls took place for the first time. Earlier, Panvel came under the jurisdiction of Raigad gram panchayat. Panvel is 55 kilometres away from Mumbai and is a fairly urban centre. The BJP swept the municipality bagging 51/78 wards. PWP-INC-NCP alliance managed to win 27 seats. The PWP contested a maximum of 48 seats from the alliance and managed to win half of it (23). Partners NCP and INC fared poorly bagging two seats each out of 30 contested. Shiv Sena received a big jolt as it could not even open its account. In Assembly elections, on two seats which fall under the jurisdiction of corporation, BJP and PWP had won one seat each. Representational image. Reuters. In Bhiwandi-Nizampur corporation, Congress won majority bagging 47/90 seats. This is a significant jump from 2012, when it won 26 seats and had to tie up with Shiv Sena for mayor position. The BJP managed to double its councilors with 19 seats versus eight in 2012. Shiv Sena lost four seats compared to its 2012 tally of 16. The NCP which had formed an alliance with SP couldn’t even open its account while the Hindi heartland party bagged two seats. Bhiwandi is the logistical hub of Mumbai and Bhiwandi city (a section of the corporation) has a majority Muslim population. Devendra Fadnavis led a spirited campaign promising 4-5 lakh jobs which seems to have benefitted the BJP. Malegaon municipality has thrown a hung House in line with 2012 with Congress bagging 28 and NCP-JDS alliance 27 seats. Congress gained three while NCP has lost two seats compared to 2012. Shiv Sena has bagged 13 while BJP has made a strong opening with nine seats. NCP-AIMIM alliance was ruling the corporation but contested separately this time. Many possibilities can still take shape Congress + Shiv Sena or Congress + NCP + JDS or NCP + Shiv Sena + JDS. Malegaon like Bhiwandi is a Muslim majority area where BJP has traditionally performed poorly. The results have significant impact on Maharashtra politics and a clear trend is emerging. National parties — BJP and Congress — have emerged as the principal parties in Maharashtra. This is a departure from the dominance of regional parties NCP and Shiv Sena for most of the past two decades. The results will likely increase the tension between BJP and Shiv Sena. With Panvel, Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad BJP’s dominance around Mumbai-Pune belt is complete. It has emerged as main party ahead of Shiv Sena. The Hindi heartland party has dislodged Shiv Sena as the first preference voter of the Marathi manoos . You will see more rumblings within the alliance government in the state. Shiv Sena will try to play spoilsport for the presidential elections and will bargain hard with BJP. Shiv Sena has more than 25,000 votes and its support is crucial in getting a BJP nominee elected. It has already announced its support for Sharad Pawar if he contests. Sena has also performed better than BJP in Malegaon, its only saving grace from the poll results. In Muslim dominated areas, BJP is slowly creating a strong footing among Hindu voters. This is visible in Bhiwandi results where BJP displaced Sena as the number two party. Its differentiated messaging for different segments – polarisation as well as development – is doing the trick. Fadnavis graph will rise after these results. He led party to win Panvel and also made good progress in Bhiwandi and Malegaon (traditional weak areas for BJP). However, the plan of BJP to dissolve House to get rid of irritant Shiv Sena and win simple majority in re-elections will be put on hold. The BJP is clearly emerging as the first choice of urban voters. Its win in Panvel is reminiscent of this fact. The BJP had received 42 percent support in urban areas, 32 percent in semi-urban and 30 percent in rural areas in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. To conclude, BJP and Congress have a lot to cheer about in these results. The BJP graph is rising in Maharashtra since Lok Sabha elections. It has managed to reduce Shiv Sena as junior partner of alliance. Congress has emerged as the big daddy ahead of NCP. The results will also resonate in the presidential polls with Shiv Sena likely to thwart BJP attempts to get its man elected after another drubbing by BJP.

""Where the country is headed is a matter of concern,"" Congress leader Digvijaya Singh tells Amit Agnihotri . Winds of change are sweeping through the Congress. States like Goa, where the party could not form a government despite emerging as the single-largest block in the assembly polls, and in Karnataka, which will hold assembly polls next year, have been taken away from your charge. Do you see any link between events in Goa and these changes in the party? No. The decision to bring about changes in the All India Congress Committee has been taken by party President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-President Rahul Gandhi. It is a process of reform in the AICC. There is no question of me or anyone else feeling otherwise. As for Goa, the Bharatiya Janata Party formed the government through the back door by buying the support of regional parties. It was helped by the state governor who did not invite the Congress first to form the government. What is your assessment of the Manohar Parrikar government in Goa? strong Politics in Goa is usually marked by mobility. Governments have been formed, toppled and formed again. The game goes on. In the past, only two governments -- that of the Congress led by Digambar Kamat or the previous BJP one led by Manohar Parrikar and later by Laxmikant Parsekar -- have completed full terms. And Karnataka? There is huge support for the Congress in the state. I see no reason why we should not win there. I am sure the new general secretary in charge, K C Venugopal, will take a call on what to do. I think some changes are planned in the state unit where PCC ( Pradesh Congress Committee ) chief G Parameshwara has been a minister. You have been in the news recently over your allegations that the Chhattisgarh government was hand-in-glove with the Maoists. Can you explain that? Whenever there are polls, especially since 2003, there is evidence that the BJP leaders strike a deal with the Maoists through the local traders. Chief Minister Raman Singh benefits from this arrangement. I have said this earlier and I stand my ground. During my term as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, I eliminated traders who had become middlemen between the government and Maoists. I am saying this with authority. Further, I am surprised that the support that the CRPF ( Central Reserve Police Force ) should get from the police is missing in the state. For instance, in the latest attack in Sukma in which 25 CRPF soldiers were killed, there were intelligence gaps . The CRPF camp was just 2 to 3 km away from the site where the attack took place, but there was no intelligence about Maoist movement in such large numbers. There is no understanding between the police and the CRPF. You dropped another bombshell alleging the Telangana police was encouraging Muslims to become radicals... There was a counter-terrorism meet in Delhi where this subject came up. Chiefs of anti-terror bodies from some states raised the issue of a fake portal being run by the Telangana police, which is attracting radicals among Muslims. The police is saying such criticism will affect the morale of the force, but is not denying the existence of the portal. The Telangana police is encouraging Muslim youth to get radicalised and then arrests them. It has arrested 10 to 12 such youth in the past. Sonia Gandhi is busy forging Opposition unity over the Presidential polls to counter an aggressive BJP under Prime Minister Modi. Is it a good strategy? It is a historical fact that whichever party is in the Opposition tries to put up a candidate for the post of President. Credit goes to Sonia Gandhi that she is talking to various Opposition leaders to bring them on a common platform. If regional parties like the Shiv Sena, the AIADMK ( All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ), BJD ( Biju Janata Dal ) and the Shiromani Akali Dal can work out a compromise candidate, I think that person stands a fairly good chance to win. The Congress has said it has an open mind if Modi consults the party over his presidential nominee. The prime minister should reach out to the Opposition like ( then prime minister ) Atal Bihari Vajpayee did to enlist support for the NDA's ( National Democratic Alliance ) Presidential nominee A P J Abdul Kalam in 2002. Modi should make a similar effort. Though he is not used to consulting the Opposition on key national issues, this is an opportunity for him to prove otherwise and get an image makeover. Another issue that has united the Opposition is faulty electronic voting machines. Do you support the view, as some veteran Congress leaders think otherwise? In the age of technology, nothing is tamper-proof. The Uttarakhand high court is looking into the issue, the Uttar Pradesh government has said smartphones were used to steal petrol from petrol pumps In the case of EVMs, who develops the software, who makes the chips? EVM tampering can be done selectively. If there is an iota of suspicion in the mind of any political party it is time to get back to the paper ballot. Many developed countries are using the paper ballot. When is Rahul Gandhi getting promoted? At present, he is focusing on poll-going states and party changes in a phased manner. It seems there is not going to be any big-bang AICC reshuffle. Party polls are due. To me, whether Rahul becomes party chief through a CWC ( Congress Working Committee ) decision or via internal elections does not make a difference. He should have taken over as party chief yesterday . The earlier that happens, the better. How can the Congress counter the BJP? What are the challenges before the Congress today? The BJP practices the politics of hatred and communal divide. The very idea of India is under threat. The RSS ( Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ) is creating divisions between religious groups. There are no jobs , the economy is slowing down, but the BJP is more concerned with issues like triple talaq , anti-Romeo squads and the beef ban . Where the country is headed is a matter of concern. The BJP wants to take us back to the 19th century. What we need is a liberal and modern mindset. Only a national party can take on the BJP. It is a great opportunity for the Congress to regain its strength for which the party has to restructure and re-engineer its strategy, fight back and defeat communal forces. The challenge would be to re-strengthen the organisation across states and bring together like-minded parties simultaneously.

AAP’s confrontational encounters and politics of antithesis have eroded their electoral base. Read more about AAP has Decimated a Historic Mandate for Alternative Politics Party with a Difference? Vol. 52, Issue No. 15, 15 Apr, 2017 Of Power and Politics Suhas Palshikar From adopting winnability as the core principle of nominating candidates to removing political appointees of the previous government, and in dealing with governments of opposition parties, the behaviour of the Bharatiya Janata Party has been so much like the Congress that the latter would rejoice in the assurance that there is no mukti from its ways and manners. The crucial difference between the BJP and other parties is that it is able to instil a sense of destiny not just among its rank and file but also the general public and convince it that the party is doing desh seva while others have been doing only politics.

India’s Second Dominant Party System Vol. 52, Issue No. 12, 25 Mar, 2017 Commentary Suhas Palshikar The conflation between nationalism and Hindutva has been the backbone of the new hegemony. That is why the Bharatiya Janata Party has been so happy with intellectuals trying to problematise the nation. That particular intellectual initiative simultaneously places the BJP in a position of immense advantage and ensures that “anti-BJP” would necessarily be equated with the anti-national! Independently, both ideas—Hindutva and development—are potent political discourses. By weaving them together with nationalism, Narendra Modi has bound them into an arsenal of his political offensive. Read more about India’s Second Dominant Party System Messages, Mathematics and Silences in BJP’s UP Win Vol. 52, Issue No. 12, 25 Mar, 2017 Commentary Radhika Ramaseshan The Bharatiya Janata Party consolidated the support of the “leftover” castes such as the Gujjar, Tyagi, Brahmin, Saini and Kashyap who are not counted in the typical matrix fashioned for years on the basis of the “dominant” groupings like the Jats, Muslims and Dalits. Accompanying the mathematics were a slew of ideas about Muslims and Yadavs as oppressors, and a strategic silence so as to not polarise all Muslim votes to benefit the BSP.

It does not have the organisational network that the Akali Dal has nor a popular leader such as the Congress' Amarinder Singh.

This misconception has given rise to several wild theories about how Muslims participate in electoral arena—that they vote in large numbers, their decision of whom to vote for is influenced by clerics, they are more concerned about religious issues while voting, and are less supportive of India’s political institutions. This article presents a body of evidence using public opinion and election returns data from Uttar Pradesh to show that the political and electoral behaviour of Muslims is no different from that of any other major community in the state.

As of Thursday, 13,523 villages have been electrified, but 100% household connectivity has been achieved in only 1,089 villages, according to data in the power ministry’s Grameen Vidyutikaran dashboard . Besides, 25% (45 million) of rural households across the country still have no electricity. In Uttar Pradesh, Nagaland, Jharkhand and Bihar, fewer than 50% of rural households have electricity, three years after the BJP was sworn in at the Centre having promised “electricity for all”. Among the 43.5 million below-poverty-line households identified to be provided with free electricity connections under the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana, 23.5 million (59%) have been covered, and many geographically remote locations have been connected with off-grid sources of power. However, this kind of basic energy access does not provide larger benefits to recipients, and is not a substitute for grid connections, studies show. As the BJP government completes three years in office this week, IndiaSpend is analysing five of its key electoral promises – on employment, Swachh Bharat, roads, access to electricity and terrorism. In the fourth part of the series today, we look at how the government has performed on providing access to electricity. Households remain without power A village is considered electrified if electricity is provided in public places such as schools, panchayat offices, health centres, dispensaries and community centres, and at least 10% of households, according to the criteria used by the power ministry since October 1997. So, a village can be considered electrified if 90% of its households do not have electricity. https://data.gov.in/resources/progress-report-village-electrification-march-2017/download As such, household-level data is a better metric to assess citizens’ access to electricity. At the household level, several states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Nagaland and Uttar Pradesh report less than 50% of their rural households have electricity supply, data from the ministry of power show. As of May 16, while 73% of the 18,452 villages identified for electrification had power, only 8% of these villages had all their households electrified, according to data published by the ministry of power. “Two challenges to electrifying households is one, many poor households cannot afford to pay the upfront cost of connection, which ranges from Rs 2,000- Rs 3,000 depending on the state,” Abhishek Jain, senior programme lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a not-for-profit research institution based in New Delhi, told IndiaSpend. “And second, even if they get connections, the supply is far from reliable; so there is no incentive for rural households above the poverty line to connect to the grid.” This is because families below poverty line get free connections. This suggests that the challenge of 100% electrification can only be overcome through concerted improvements at various levels – not the least in the income levels of rural households and in the reliability of power supply. Source: Ministry of Power ‘100% village electrification by May 2018’ In 2014, when the BJP came to power, India had the world’s largest energy access deficit in terms of electricity – 270 million people, accounting for just under a third of the world’s deficit, according to the World Bank’s 2017 State of Electricity Access report . “Certain segments of India have been historically disadvantaged. Due to a lopsided development approach and skewed allocation of resources, they continue to lag behind the rest of the country in socioeconomic indicators,” the BJP had said in its manifesto for the 2014 general election, promising to ensure equitable growth and development by “Ensuring a basic level of Infrastructure to all – Home, Electricity, Water, Toilets and Access”. The previous Congress-led government, under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana, a rural electrification scheme, had connected 108,280 villages to the grid between 2005-’06 and 2013-’14. From 2014 to 2017, under the BJP’s rural electrification drive, 14,528 villages have been electrified. On average, the United Progressive Alliance government electrified 12,030 villages per year, while the BJP government has electrified 4,842 – less than half the UPA’s average. In the BJP’s third year, 2016-’17, 6,015 villages were electrified, five times more than in 2013-’14, according to this May 19 press release by the ministry of power, but fewer than the villages electrified the year before in 2015-’16. Celebrating the achievement, power minister Piyush Goyal tweeted: “In the past three years rural electrification has witnessed an unprecedented change, and it is our aim to provide everyone with 24×7 power.” ????? ??? ?????? ??? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ???????? ??? ??, ??? ?? 24x7 ????? ???? ????? ?????? ?? | https://t.co/QXW37OVM81 — Piyush Goyal (@PiyushGoyal) May 19, 2017 Source: Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd data; Power Ministry press release. Source: Ministry of Power Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Northeastern states lagging Of the 4,492 villages that remained to be electrified at the end of March, 2,268 were scheduled for grid connection, 2,196 for off-grid electrification because of geographical barriers, and 28 for electrification by state governments, according to data from the Central Electricity Authority. Source: Ministry of Power Most off-grid village projects are concentrated in states such as Arunachal Pradesh (958), Assam (357), Jharkhand (356) and Chhattisgarh (306). Studies have shown that decentralised solutions that provide consumers with basic energy access do not provide larger socio-economic benefits, and are not a substitute for grid-connected electricity, as IndiaSpend reported on May 18. Once provided off-grid power and marked as “electrified”, a village provides lesser of an incentive to the government to provide grid connectivity, further dimming the prospects of villages that already count among the least developed in the country. As part of the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana, the BJP’s rural electrification scheme, the government had also proposed to provide free electricity connections to over 43.5 million rural households below the poverty line (with the poverty line set at Rs 816 per capita per month for rural areas). As of April 2017, 25.68 million BPL households (58.9%) were provided free electricity connections, according to this report by the power ministry. Between 2005, when the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana was launched, and March 2013, a total of 20.5 million BPL households were provided free electricity connections. However, the connection these households get is often unreliable, and the two free-of-cost LED bulbs they are entitled to are often siphoned off to the black market by unscrupulous sub-contractors, IndiaSpend found during travels in villages of eastern Uttar Pradesh. As per the Modi government’s promise, all of India’s villages could be electrified by May. However, it remains to be seen how many households will actually have access to reliable electricity supply. Despite villages having an electricity connection, true energy access remains low in many states, marked by poor quality, reliability and duration of supply, as IndiaSpend reported in October 2015.

Harish Rao explains a point to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao while Deputy CM Mohd. Mahmood Ali and MP K. Kesava Rao look on, at a TRS party meeting in Hyderabad on Saturday. (Photo: DC) Hyderabad: TRS president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday said that the party will win 111 of the 119 Assembly seats in the state if elections were to be held now. Disclosing the results of the latest survey, Mr Rao told the TRS Parliamentary and Legislature Party meeting held in the Telangana Bhavan that the MIM will get six seats, all in Hyderabad, and the Congress would win only two seats, one from Madhira (presently held by Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and the other from Kalwakurthy (at present represented by Challa Vamsi Chand Reddy). He said that the survey results were clear that the TRS will bag 16 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats in the state and the remaining seat will be bagged by MIM president Asaduddin Owaisi from Hyderabad. Mr Rao said TRS leaders need not worry about BJP’s claims of coming to power in the state. According to the survey, BJP will not win a single seat if elections were to be held today, though it holds five seats now, Mr Rao said. He said that the “Modi wave” would not have any impact in TS in the 2019 elections. As far as individual ratings of MLAs, based on their performance in their Assembly constituencies, is concerned, Mr Rao tops the list with a rating of 98 per cent, followed by his minister son K.T. Rama Rao who got 91 per cent. His nephew, minister T. Harish Rao, came third with 88 per cent. Former Deputy Chief Minister T. Rajaiah representing the Station Ghanpur seat in the erstwhile Warangal district came in fourth place. Mr Rao also hinted in the meeting that the Centre will introduce an amendment in the monsoon session of Parliament on fresh delimitation of Assembly constituencies. Mr Rao specifically asked the party cadre, especially legislators to regularly meet and take stock of the political and administrative situation in their respective districts and mandals to ensure effective politicking. He said that very soon, orders will be issued naming one minister in-charge of two districts due to the increased number of districts for better coordination.

Here are seven ways for the BJP to stay ahead BJP's win in UP hints at a general election victory in 2019; if that result comes to pass, the BJP gets seven years more in power. Sitaraman Shankar Moneycontrol News In its three years in power, the BJP has won both worshippers and enemies with its take-no-prisoners approach. Political foes have been subdued or rendered irrelevant, dissent isn’t particularly audible, and the party and its affiliates continue to be prescriptive in their attitude. The win in Uttar Pradesh appears to have all but sealed a general election victory in 2019; if that result comes to pass, it gives the BJP seven years more in power. Here are seven ways for it to stay ahead: 1 Sell the economy, and security : The party has shown admirable restraint in not going down the populist route, except a measure here and there. There are real successes to show on the economic front as detailed above. Security is a mildly Goebbelsian theme where fear and hope can be adroitly mixed. Do people feel safer under a BJP government? The majority – and the choice of the word is important – probably do. 2 Be seen to plan for the big variables : How the BJP handles the fallout of any monsoon vagaries – it’s too early to tell about this year – and changes in global oil prices is critical. The government held its nerve through a period of dismal export performance, and now things are beginning to pick up. 3 Realise how saleable nationalism is : If not overdone, this could replace Mandir, black money, and to some extent even Congress-mukt as a leitmotif. It is a fairly durable idea that anyone can be bullied into being on the right side of. It also accentuates the idea of the “other”, always central to the Hindu right’s way of operating. Very few middle-class Indians would have a problem with large flags fluttering in campuses across the country, especially after the Srinagar NIT shenanigans; the views of a few students may excite intellectuals for a few days but count for little in the overall scheme of things. Nationalism, however, obnoxiously framed, is acceptable to many more people than madcap notions of intrinsic Hindu superiority or evolved ideas like internationalism. The jury’s still out on beef, but chances are that it’s a trump card that the more cynical election planners will pull out from time to time. At most times, if you like, nationalism is the new beef, and a popular cut. 4 Keep a couple of big, dramatic ideas in the bag : Case in point, demonetisation. When things are flagging or newsflow feels stale, pull out something that galvanizes people, because there is nothing people like more than getting into mission mode. Modi is adept at understanding the public pulse and more than capable of the dramatic gesture, so watch this space. (Don’t ask what: by definition, these ideas are difficult for outsiders to spot. If they weren’t, they would be less effective.) 5. ‘Congress-mukt Bharat’ still has some legs : As long as the Grand Old Party doesn’t undergo a massive revamp and isn’t energised by real leadership, it will remain an easy target for pot shots; the familiar refrain about what it did not do in 60 years in power will be heard often and contrasted with the flurry of activity under the NDA government. This is the political equivalent of scoring into an open goal, gratifying even if there’s no real challenge. Must Watch: PM Modi’s 3 years in power - New initiatives, victories & conflicts 6. Relax. Bad news, in modest doses, is harmless : As long as the news doesn’t have a direct impact on voters, the BJP can sit tight and wait for it to blow over. The news cycle moves on relentlessly – does anyone remember the second-year travails of Vasundhara Raje and Sushma Swaraj? Unless the Opposition shows preternatural determination keeping the focus on issues – and there’s no indication it will, or that enough people are listening -- you can get away with the odd bad hair day. This is different from UPA2, which tended to get skewered for days on end by TV channels. 7. Realise that a lack of grace catches up with you : The BJP showed boorishness in its dealings with the Opposition after it came to power, and its leadership displayed the same tactics internally. It paid for the first with the difficulty it faced getting even the most non-controversial legislation through; internal strife has yet to rear its head, but when the knives come out, they will be sharper for the wait. Its attitude on imposing Hindi in the south, and food habits on the whole country, are worrying developments. It can still remedy things with a more statesmanly approach, but no one, as they say, is holding their breath. tags ##3YearsofModigovt #BJP #Business #Congress #Global oil prices #India #NDA government #Politics #Uttar Pradesh Related news Politics Government can save lot if affluent sections opt out of freebies: Puducherry CM May 27, 2017 04:16 PM Politics New rules will ensure that cattle is not ill-treated: Maneka Gandhi May 27, 2017 04:13 PM Business Video: RBI's fight against NPAs May 27, 2017 03:09 PM India ICSE Class 10 Results 2017, ISC Class 12 Results 2017 to be declared on May 29; check on www.cisce.org May 27, 2017 02:10 PM Business Rajasthan Board's RBSE Senior Secondary Class 12 Arts Result Declared; check grades on rajeduboard.rajasthan.gov.in or rajresults.nic.in May 27, 2017 02:05 PM Business People with black money fear Modi government: Amit Shah May 27, 2017 01:39 PM World Secretary-General's good offices available to India, Pak: UN May 27, 2017 01:13 PM Business NGT allows reopening of textile units in Rajasthan May 27, 2017 12:55 PM Business Auto weekly wrap: Merc gets cheaper, M&M charts roadmap for EV push May 27, 2017 12:20 PM News Most Popular Top News Early rains to shower hope for Sensex; top 10 stocks to chase this monsoon Tata Motors cuts up to 1,500 managerial jobs Mid & smallcap stocks crack; 10 stocks which can give up to 50% return This smallcap could pump more profits as it now starts to leverage its assets And you thought it is over!

The BJP's origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, formed in 1951 by Syama Prasad Mookerjee. After the State of Emergency in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party. After three years in power, the Janata party dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP. LIVE: MCD election results 2017 Delhi MCD elections After the 1998 general election, the BJP-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) formed a government under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for a year. Following fresh elections, the NDA government, again headed by Vajpayee, lasted for a full term in office. For the next ten years the BJP was the principal opposition party. In the 2014 general election, Narendra Modi led it to a landslide victory. Narendra Modi was sworn in as the 15th Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014. BJP won the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections by an overwheming three-quarter majority of 325 seats, despite not projecting a chief ministerial candidate before the election. It also won the state assembly elections in Uttarakhand. The BJP-SAD alliance in Punjab lost the 2017 assembly elections with each winning 3 and 15 seats respectively. In Manipur BJP won 21 seats and 13 seats in Goa. Read More LAST UPDATED : 28 May 2017, 06:42 IST ALL ITEMS NEWS PHOTOS VIDEOS SORT ANYTIME ANYTIME LAST 24 HRS PAST 4 DAYS PAST WEEK PAST MONTH Walking in the stilettos of sari-clad Mayamma 2017-05-28T01:12:47.743Z Alex Mathew My first performance as a drag queen was at a QAMI (Queer Arts Movement of India) event that was held in late 2014 in Bengaluru. There was a time when I'd sing songs by Tina Turner and Madonna wearing a snazzy jacket and hat at QAMI events but the audience just wouldn't get why a `guy' was singing songs by female pop artistes.That is when I hit upon the idea to perform in drag instead. In September 2014, Mayamma, the sariclad Malayali `lady' who sings English songs with a pronounced Malayali lilt was born. When I started out as a drag performer, I had no clue as to where I was headed. My struggles were more internal ­ it was about me getting comfortable with who I was, and about getting my family to accept me. I started it because I wanted to have fun and satiate my need to perform. These days, the struggle is more external ­ finding venues that are open to host performances by Mayamma, or finding crowds to watch her perform. But in terms of opportunities to perform, the going has been good so far. Opportunities that have come my way in the last year include invitations to talk at Manipal Institute of Communication, give a TEDX talk at Delhi's Sri Guru Gobind College of Commerce, besides being featured in sari campaigns for eBay and AJIO Life. I have played a drag queen in Kirtana Kumar's play The Wedding Party, I also hosted and performed at The Humming Tree's New Year's eve party this year as Mayamma. I danced to Madhuri Dixit's hits and the crowds just loved it. What's heartwarming about these opportunities, however, is that they validate Mayamma as a legitimate persona. Today, my drag queen act is not for mere entertainment. I am not one for carrying placards and hollering protests, so, the way I see it, Mayamma is a symbol of gender equality, and every time I walk on the stage dressed as a woman, it is my way of telling people to be comfortable with their sexuality. The reactions I get from the audiences are largely positive. I have young kids tell me that they look up to me. At the TEDX talk I gave, the front row that had the college management seemed disinterested, but the kids were rooting for me. After the talk, the girls gave me a standing ovation. I had a second year medical student telling me, “you inspire me to be who I am'. Women generally tend to be supportive of my drag queen persona. They tell me that they just feel this need to support transwomen. I have had women coming up to me and sharing their problems. I have had a lot of them complimenting me on my saris, and makeup! It is quite unlike the West where transgenders and drag queens diss women. With men, however, it's tricky. When they see a man dressed in a sari, they don't know how to react because it's almost like am making them question their sexuality. There's this one instance I remember, in Mumbai, where I was shooting for a campaign, and I could see the bouncers of the pub making fun of me because I was dressed in a sari. I just smiled it off and continued with my perfor mance.Later, after the shoot, I had a guard come up to me and tell me that “my performance was kickass“. My battle is won every time I have people who first jeer me, later tell me that they love me. Where does Bengaluru fit into all this? I began my journey as a drag queen here. It is one of the few cities in India that encourages drag queen performances, and has certainly helped me in my journey as Mayamma so far. Not just that, it is Bengaluru's open culture that allows me to be both a drag queen and an out-and-proud gay man. As told to Mahalakshmi Prabhakaran (In this column, people record their impressions of life in Bengaluru) British PM May is retreating from globalisation, George Osborne says 2017-05-27T22:20:27.317Z BRITAIN-ELECTION/OSBORNE (CORRECTED):REFILE-British PM May is retreating from globalisation, George Osborne says British PM May is retreating from globalisation, George Osborne says 2017-05-27T22:00:27.937Z BRITAIN-ELECTION/OSBORNE:British PM May is retreating from globalisation, George Osborne says Conviction rare in deaths due to negligence 2017-05-27T21:53:45.507Z After a study of deaths due to negligence in the capital, the Dialogue and Development Commission, a think tank of the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi Government, found that a shockingly low 0.95% of cases registered in such incidents had ended in conviction Never promised a free hackathon: Election Commission 2017-05-27T21:44:47.810Z The Election Commission (EC) on Saturday said that it had never made a “promise” to hold a “no-holds-barred hackathon” when it had announced the EVM hacking challenge. BJP government's ad-spending Rs 2,000 crore: Manish Sisodia 2017-05-27T21:32:20.993Z Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Saturday hit out at the BJP-ruled states for allegedly spending public money on advertisements to celebrate three years of the Modi government. He alleged that over Rs 2,000 crore was spent by these states for the celebrations. Kapil Mishra now alleges Satyendar Jain’s role in Rs 300 crore health department scam 2017-05-27T21:17:02.383Z Days after he was sacked from the Delhi cabinet, Karawal Nagar MLA Kapil Mishra alleged that health minister Satyendar Jain was involved in a Rs 300-crore “scam”. He claimed that the scam pertained to procurement of “unwanted medicines”. Panvel: Post results, BJP, Sena downplay electoral rivalry 2017-05-27T18:45:09.007Z NAVI MUMBAI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) elections by winning 51 out of the 78 seats in the maiden election for the 78-member house of the PCMC, whose results were declared on Friday. However, a day after the verdict on Saturday, both the BJP and Shiv Sena downplayed the perception that there was any bitterness in the alliance government and leaders. The BJP swept the poll even as the party did not have single member in the erstwhile council, while the Sena drew a blank. Speaking to TOI on Saturday, BJP Panvel MLA, Prashant Thakur said, “The Sena could have agreed to the seat sharing talks, but were interested in finding its vote base.’’ Whereas the Sena sampark pramukh from Raigad district and prominent Marathi actor, Adesh Bandekar said, “Our vote share has increased above 40,000 and we will find more ways to expand our base.” Thakur affirmed, “Yes, the Sena had got around 17,000 votes in the state assembly poll and the vote share has increased, but we could have always contested the polls together.” BJP won nine seats out of 11 in Kamothe where Sena supremo, Udhav Thackeray had addressed a rally and made an emotional appeal to the masses by reminding them that his grandfather belonged to Panvel. CM, Devendra Fadnavis, ensured the victory of development face of the government and won 36 of the 49 seats from Kharghar and New Panvel node (that includes the old township) where he addressed rallies; the other two were won by a faction of the RPI in alliance. The BJP not only targeted around 57% (approximately) of the total electorate in the CM rally, but also ensured that it won maximum seats on its own because it contested 76 out of the 78 seats. Keeping the 2015 NMMC election in mind, where BJP had won just six seats when they had contested in alliance with the Sena, Fadnavis this time decided to contest the polls without any alliance and won comprehensively The mood was upbeat in the BJP camp during the vote counting on Friday. “The CM congratulated me and said the promises need to be fulfilled,” said a thrilled Thakur who will be working under CM’s guidance. — Sanjay Banerjee Urban voters play key role, help BJP win PCMC polls 2017-05-27T18:35:08.437Z While urban voters played a decisive role, mostly supporting BJP to post an impressive victory in the maiden PCMC polls, a major chunk of rural and semi-urban voters preferred not to switch side in most parts and remained loyal to the local Bharatiya Shetkari Kamgar Paksha (BSKP). Sons take on bigger role in party works 2017-05-27T17:44:52.210Z Visakhapatnam: A team of youngsters are working hard to ensure the Mahanadu is a success. Most of them are sons of senior MLAs and ministers led by TDP national general secretary and minister Nara Lokesh. Apart from assigning different roles to these youngsters, Lokesh has also created a WhatsApp group to coordinate with them. Minister Paritala Sunita’s son Sriram, AP TDP chief and minister Kala Venkata Rao’s son Mallick, MP Avanti Srinivas’s son Sravan, Somireddy Chandra Mohan Reddy’s son Prasanna, Ayyanna Patrudu’s son Vijay, Silpa Mohan Reddy’s son Ravi, Silpa Chakrapani Reddy’s son Karthik, MP JC Diwakar Reddy’s son Pawan, Devineni Nehru’s son Avinash, former ministers Yelimineti and Uma Madhav Reddy’s son Sandeep Reddy, Karanam Balaram’s son Venkatesh, Gali Muddukrishnam Naidu’s son Bhanu, minister Siddha Raghava Rao’s son Sudhir, Bojjala Ramakrishna Reddy’s son Sudhir were seen busy in performing various roles on the first day of the Mahanadu. “For the first time we got the chance to play a part in the party’s annual plenary. Earlier, we were confined to seats. This Mahanadu is giving us ample space to organise the party cadres. The time has come for the youngsters to take the baton,” said Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy’s son Appala Naidu, who was given charge of media, stage and sanitation in the Mahanadu. “The present generation with new technologies should take the centre stage in the politics,” minister Somireddy Chandra Mohan Reddy commented. Paritala Sriram was given charge of transport committee, Chintakayala Vijay is in-charge of food committee, while Silpa brothers are handling cultural activities. “When I called my son in the morning, he said he was in the railway station.

AAP to form mohalla committees ahead of UP local body elections 2017-05-27T17:13:44.610Z BAREILLY: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will set up mohalla committees to strengthen its base in the state ahead of the local body elections scheduled for September. Each committee will cover 30 houses and the party is looking at setting them up in the next 45 days. AAP’s UP in-charge Sanjay Singh said that corruption in house, water and sewer tax and construction of drains and roads will be the main election issues of the party. “We have set up a target of 45 days to form committees at the nagar palika, nagar panchayat and municipal corporation levels. We will run a membership campaign to form nagar, ward, booth and mohalla committees,” Singh, who was in Bareilly on Saturday, said. He added, “A mohalla committee will be just below booth committee. We are dividing one booth in 10 parts and each mohalla committee will cover 30 houses. A booth will have 10 mohalla heads.” This will be the first time that AAP will be contesting civic polls in UP. Unlike other parties which only have committees at the block level, AAP is aiming at reaching out e maximum number of people through mohalla committees. The party also plans to organise a convention in Bareilly on July 15 to rope in more members. After inducting at least 3,000 workers through these committees, AAP will then start its next leg of campaigning by raising local issues. “Corruption will be the main issue for the party. We will be contesting on our own and will not tie-up with any other political outfit,” said Singh. Ban on cow slaughter: UDF to observe black day on Monday 2017-05-27T16:03:32.517Z THRISSUR: The UDF will observe Monday as ""black day"" across the state to protest against the ban ordered by the Centre against the sale of cattle for slaughter. Announcing at a Press conference here on Saturday the leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that the ban on the sale of cattle for slaughter is a crazy decision and the UDF would oppose it politically and legally. Chennithala said the attempt of the Modi regime to decide what food the people should eat tantamounts to state terrorism and was another example of the ""gunda raj"" being enforced by the current rulers at the Centre. The ban on the sale of cattle for slaughter will decimate the pluralistic lineage and economic backbone of the country. The decision will cripple 25 lakh farmers and it will lead to a loss of Rs 26,685 crores, the leader of opposition alleged. He also attacked the LDF government in Kerala saying that it could not launch any significant project and was a failure on all fronts. The government could not start any projects under the much-trumpeted KIFBI scheme, though the finance minister had been announcing several pipe-dream projects under it, Chennithala said. The Leader of Opposition made it clear that the UDF would not take part in any efforts which the government would be launching to build up a consensus on the proposed Athirappilli hydro-electric project, and would vehemently oppose the project. Asked whether the UDF will join hands with the CPI for opposing the Athirappilli project, he said the UDF will oppose the project on its own. According to him reports that the Janata Dal (U) led by M P Veerendrakumar was only a figment of imagination of the media . Meanwhile a host of organisations have come out to protest against the ban ordered by the Centre against the sale of cattle for slaughter. The SFI organized a ""beef festival"" on Saturday in Thrissur. The Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) also organized a demonstration in the city against the Centre’s decision.

A fresh survey of all properties will be conducted and non-registered properties will be assessed for increasing the tax collection. The budget also promised to start work for implementing the 24x7 water supply scheme in 40% of the city, lay new drainage pipelines in the fringe areas, construct a global level wrestling training centre in Bhosari, and develop the Annasaheb Magar stadium like the sports city in Balewadi.
